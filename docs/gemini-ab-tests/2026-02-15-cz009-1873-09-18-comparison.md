## 1. Issue Counts by Severity

| Severity | Text-Only (A) | With-Comments (B) |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| A (must fix) | 3 | 3 |
| B (recommended) | 5 | 6 |
| C (cosmetic) | 1 | 1 |
| **Total** | **9** (+ 1 general reco) | **11** |

**Notable:** Unlike experiment #1 (where text-only found MORE issues including 2 sev-A that with-comments missed), this time with-comments found slightly MORE issues (11 vs 9). Both found the same number of sev-A issues (3 each).

## 2. Issues Found in BOTH Versions

These 5 issues were identified by both approaches:

| Issue | Text-Only | With-Comments |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| „slyšel jsi zvonit, ale nevíš na kterém kostele" (wrong preposition in idiom) | B | B |
| „má krásná miláčku" (gender mismatch - miláček is masculine) | A | A |
| „biji nohou do koberce" (literal calque of battre du pied) | B | B |
| „povídají o partie" (mistranslation of bataclan) | -- | B |
| „mám na sobě něco špatného" (too vague for fashion context) | -- | C |

Core overlap: 3 issues identified identically by both. The idiom fix, the gender error, and the literal "bít nohou" calque were reliably caught regardless of method.

## 3. Issues Found ONLY by Text-Only (A)

| Issue | Sev | Note |
|-------|-----|------|
| „čpí z ní Nice" — argues čpět is too negative, suggests dýchá/čiší | A | Interestingly, this was ALREADY a GEM correction in the file. With-comments Gemini recognized it as its own prior fix and praised it instead of re-flagging it. |
| „jsou oddělení" — galicismus for marital separation | A | Clear semantic error, only caught without comments |
| „já jsem na to odpověděla" — clitic placement, redundant pronoun | B | Stylistic, text-only more aggressive on word order |
| „jedním slovem se tomu chtějí postavit" — French word order | B | Spotted the calque of "en un mot" positioning |
| „dělají hrozné ceremonie" — false friend (ceremonie vs okolky) | B | False friend identification |
| „vycházím z kabinky v kostýmu" — false friend (costume) | B | Period-appropriate vocabulary suggestion |
| „jehož život není životem pro manželství" — awkward construction | C | Minor stylistic |

## 4. Issues Found ONLY by With-Comments (B)

| Issue | Sev | Note |
|-------|-----|------|
| „Chci jít koupat se do moře" — clitic se placement | A | Precise grammatical fix, with paragraph reference |
| „bez dovolení od Walitského" — calque of "permission de" | B | Identified French prepositional pattern |
| „Je pořád přede mnou" — suggests idiomatic „mít před očima" | B | Semantic improvement leveraging French context |
| „tlačí na dech" — non-standard Czech collocation | B | Suggests „svírá dech" |
| „Mám zimnici v zádech" — zimnice = disease, not frisson | A | Significant semantic error |
| „Představuje se mi" — false friend (se présenter vs představit se) | B | French context helped identify the calque |

## 5. Cases Where Comments Helped Find Semantic Issues

1. **„bataclan" → „partie"**: With-comments correctly identified that the French word "bataclan" was mistranslated as "partie" — it could see the original French and knew bataclan means "the whole shebang/circus", not "party". Text-only didn't flag this at all (it couldn't see the mismatch without the French).

2. **„Představuje se mi"**: With the French "il se présente" visible, Gemini B recognized the false friend pattern — Czech "představovat se" means introducing oneself, while the French means "appearing/manifesting". Text-only missed this entirely.

3. **„Je pořád přede mnou"**: With the French "il est toujours devant moi" visible, Gemini B correctly identified this as a mental image (obsession) and suggested the more idiomatic Czech „mít před očima". Text-only read it literally and didn't flag it.

4. **„Mám zimnici v zádech"**: With "frisson dans le dos" visible, Gemini B correctly identified that "zimnice" (a disease/fever) is wrong for "frisson" (a shiver of emotion). This is a significant semantic error that text-only completely missed.

## 6. Cases Where Text-Only Found Issues That With-Comments Missed

1. **„čpí z ní Nice"**: This is the most fascinating case. This phrasing was itself a PREVIOUS Gemini correction (visible in the GEM comments). When Gemini B saw its own prior correction note, it praised it rather than questioning it further. Gemini A, seeing only the Czech text without that context, independently flagged "čpí" as too negative (A severity). This demonstrates a **self-confirmation bias** — with-comments Gemini trusted its own prior work.

2. **„jsou oddělení"** (A severity): A clear galicismus for marital separation. Text-only caught this as a must-fix; with-comments overlooked it entirely despite having the French "ils sont séparés" available.

3. **False friends „ceremonie" and „kostým"**: Text-only identified two false friends (French ceremonie/costume vs Czech ceremonie/kostým having different connotations). With-comments missed both, possibly because seeing the French originals made the literal translations seem more natural/justified.

4. **„jedním slovem" word order**: Text-only noticed the French-influenced position of this phrase. With-comments didn't flag it.

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Scoring
- **Text-Only (A):** 7/10 naturalness rating, 9 issues found (3A, 5B, 1C)
- **With-Comments (B):** 8/10 naturalness rating, 11 issues found (3A, 6B, 1C)

### Key Findings

**This experiment partially contradicts Experiment #1's finding that text-only finds MORE issues.** Here, with-comments found slightly more issues (11 vs 9) and the same number of severity-A problems (3 each). However, the TYPE of issues found differs significantly:

**Text-Only strengths (confirmed from Exp #1):**
- Better at catching **false friends** (ceremonie, kostým, čpět) — without French context, it evaluates Czech words purely on Czech merits
- Better at spotting **word order calques** — reads the Czech as a native reader would
- **No self-confirmation bias** — flags issues regardless of prior GEM corrections
- More aggressive on stylistic naturalness (lower score: 7/10 vs 8/10)

**With-Comments strengths (new finding):**
- Better at catching **semantic errors** where Czech sounds plausible but means something different from the French (zimnice vs frisson, představovat se vs se présenter, bataclan)
- Provides **paragraph references** (009.0217 etc.) making fixes easier to locate
- Can identify **mistranslations** invisible without the source (bataclan → partie)
- More precise grammatical fixes (clitic placement with specific context)

### Pattern Across Both Experiments

| Finding | Exp #1 (005/1873-05-31) | Exp #2 (009/1873-09-18) | Pattern |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Total issues | A: 12, B: 9 | A: 9, B: 11 | Mixed — no clear winner on quantity |
| Sev-A issues | A: 2 more | Equal (3 each) | Text-only at least as good on critical issues |
| False friends | A better | A better | **Confirmed: text-only better** |
| Semantic accuracy | B better | B better | **Confirmed: with-comments better** |
| Self-confirmation bias | Not tested | A avoids it | **New finding** |
| Naturalness score | A lower | A lower | Text-only is stricter judge |

### Recommendation

**Use BOTH approaches in sequence for best results.** The optimal workflow appears to be:

1. **First pass: Text-only** — catches naturalness issues, false friends, calques, and word-order problems that a Czech reader would notice
2. **Second pass: With-comments** — catches semantic errors, mistranslations, and precision issues that require seeing the French source

Neither approach alone catches everything. The self-confirmation bias finding (Gemini praising its own prior corrections instead of re-evaluating them) is particularly important for iterative review workflows.
