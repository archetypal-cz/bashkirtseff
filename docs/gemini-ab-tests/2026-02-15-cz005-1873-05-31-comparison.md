# Gemini A/B Experiment: Comparison Analysis
## Entry: 1873-05-31 (content/cz/005/1873-05-31.md)
**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Model:** Gemini (via `gemini` CLI)

## 1. Issue Count

| Severity | Version A (text-only) | Version B (with comments) |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| A (must fix) | 2 | 0 |
| B (recommended) | 6 | 4 |
| C (cosmetic) | 2 | 2 |
| **Total** | **10** | **6** |

Version A found significantly more issues (10 vs 6). However, the higher count is not necessarily better -- see analysis below.

## 2. Unique Issues Per Version

### Issues found ONLY by Version A (text-only):
1. **"proč mi škodit?"** -- flagged as galicism (infinitive in rhetorical question). Valid catch. (B)
2. **"hrubým tónem"** -- suggested "příkrým tónem" as more period-appropriate. Minor but valid. (C)
3. **"To je poslední lekce"** -- flagged "lekce" as false friend (leçon = hodina). Marked severity A. This is a **strong catch** -- "dát lekci" in Czech means "teach someone a lesson" (punish), not "give a lesson" (teach). (A)
4. **"Absolvovaly jsme cestu"** -- flagged "absolvovat" as too modern/bureaucratic. Valid. (B)
5. **"té drahé"** -- suggested "té milostivé" for better Czech sarcasm. Debatable but interesting. (C)
6. **"To je víc než silné"** -- flagged as galicism ("c'est fort"). Valid. (B)
7. **"Bože, chceš mi odpustit"** -- flagged as galicism (veux-Tu → chceš). Excellent catch. (B)
8. **"dvěma tisícům frankům"** -- grammatical error (should be "franků"). Marked severity A. Clear grammar bug. (A)

### Issues found ONLY by Version B (with comments):
1. **Repetition "okrádá o čas"** -- noticed that the French uses two different verbs (*vole* vs *perdre*) but Czech repeats the same phrase. This is a **semantic precision issue** only catchable with access to the French. (B)
2. **"v mých slovech"** -- flagged as calque of *dans mes paroles*, suggested "na mých slovech". Minor preposition fix. (C)
3. **"jen zuřila tím víc"** -- ambiguous subject (who is raging?), suggested clarifying with "ona". Valid structural improvement. (B)
4. **"dobré" for outfit description** -- noted that French *bien* carries self-satisfied connotation about appearance. Nuanced observation. (C)

### Issues found by BOTH versions:
1. **"Musí je všude"** -- both flagged the substantivized verb as awkward. Version B gave better explanation (citing the French *un doit* as substantive noun).
2. **"sto liber z krku"** -- both flagged the metaphor. Version B added historical context (100 livres = ~50 kg) and identified the French source (*centaine de livres*).

## 3. Quality of Suggestions

### Version A's strengths:
- **Higher volume** of issues found (10 vs 6)
- **Caught two severity-A issues** that B missed entirely: the "lekce/hodina" false friend and the "frankům/franků" grammar error
- **Broader sweep** -- without French context, it examines the Czech more critically on its own terms
- **Better at detecting galicisms as a pattern** -- flagged 4 distinct galicisms (infinitive question, "c'est fort", "chceš mi odpustit", "donner une leçon")

### Version B's strengths:
- **More precise explanations** -- every issue includes the French source text for comparison
- **Caught semantic precision issues** impossible without French (the *vole/perdre* repetition)
- **Better contextual understanding** -- understood the outfit *bien* nuance, the *centaine de livres* weight reference
- **More confident scoring** -- gave 9/10 vs A's 7/10, suggesting it could better assess what was intentional vs problematic
- **Fewer false concerns** -- did not flag things that might be intentional choices

## 4. False Positives

### Version A false positives:
- **"Tady žádné musí není"** -- Version A suggested "neexistuje" but the original wordplay between "musí" (the word itself) is deliberate. Both versions flagged this, but A's suggestion ("neexistuje") would weaken the word-game more than B's ("To musí").
- **"té drahé" -> "té milostivé"** -- Debatable. The translator's comment (TR) explains the ironic "cette chère" was intentional. Version B, seeing the TR comment, did NOT flag this -- it even praised it as "trefné" (apt). Version A, without context, suggested changing it.

### Version B false positives:
- None clearly identified. All 6 issues are defensible.

## 5. Semantic Accuracy

This is where Version B has a clear structural advantage:

| Aspect | Version A | Version B |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Can detect galicisms by feel | Yes (well) | Yes (with proof) |
| Can verify meaning accuracy | No | Yes |
| Can catch lost nuances | No | Yes (*vole/perdre*) |
| Can distinguish intentional vs accidental calques | Poorly (flagged "té drahé") | Well (praised "té drahé") |
| Can explain WHY something is a galicism | Sometimes | Always (cites French) |

**Key finding:** Version B caught the *vole/perdre* repetition -- a case where the Czech uses one verb ("okrádá") for two distinct French verbs, flattening a semantic distinction. This type of issue is **invisible** without the French source.

However, Version A caught two clear errors (grammar "frankům" and false friend "lekce") that Version B missed entirely. This is surprising and significant.

## 6. Recommendation

### The paradox:
- Version B produces **higher-quality individual observations** with better reasoning
- Version A produces **more issues overall**, including critical ones B missed
- Version B's higher confidence score (9/10 vs 7/10) may indicate it is **less critical** when it can see the French -- perhaps because seeing the translator's reasoning (TR comments) makes it more sympathetic to the choices made

### Possible explanation:
When Gemini sees TR comments explaining translation decisions, it may become **anchored** to the translator's reasoning and less likely to question the output. The text-only version judges the Czech purely on its merits as Czech prose, which paradoxically makes it **more aggressive** at finding issues.

### Recommended approach: **Use both, in sequence**

1. **First pass: Text-only (Version A)** -- catches more issues, more critical, judges Czech on its own terms, finds grammar errors and galicisms that B misses
2. **Second pass: With comments (Version B)** -- adds semantic precision, catches meaning shifts, validates or corrects A's suggestions against the French

Alternatively, **a hybrid prompt** could work: send the full file but explicitly instruct Gemini to first read the Czech text independently, form judgments, and only then compare with the French. This might combine the best of both approaches.

### Cost-benefit:
- Text-only is cheaper (less tokens sent)
- Text-only found more actionable issues in this test
- With-comments found fewer but more nuanced issues
- The two approaches are complementary, not redundant

### Bottom line:
**Do not switch to comments-only.** The current text-only approach is surprisingly effective and may actually be superior for catching surface-level errors and galicisms. The with-comments approach adds value primarily for semantic accuracy verification. The ideal workflow uses both.
