## Who Was Marie?

Marie Bashkirtseff (1858–1884) was a Ukrainian-born Russian aristocrat who kept one of the most extraordinary diaries ever written. From age 13 until her death from tuberculosis at 25, she filled over 100 volumes with her thoughts, dreams, frustrations, and observations.

She was a talented painter who studied at the Académie Julian in Paris, one of the few institutions that admitted women. She exhibited at the Salon. Her painting _Un meeting_ hangs in the Musée d'Orsay.

She was a proto-feminist who wrote for _La Citoyenne_ under a pseudonym, advocating for women's suffrage and education.

She was vain, ambitious, brilliant, insecure, dramatic, and searingly honest about all of it.

She wanted, desperately, to be known and remembered.

> _"Si je ne meurs pas jeune, j'espère rester comme un grand artiste; mais si je meurs jeune, je veux laisser publier mon journal, qui ne peut manquer d'être intéressant."_
>
> (If I do not die young, I hope to remain as a great artist; but if I die young, I want to have my journal published, which cannot fail to be interesting.)

She _did_ die young. Her mother published the diary, but censored it heavily, removing Marie's romantic obsessions, harsh opinions, illness details, and anything deemed improper for a young lady.

For over a century, the world knew only a sanitized Marie.

## The Problem

The complete, uncensored diary was discovered and finally transcribed and published in French between 1995 and 2005 by the Cercle des Amis de Marie Bashkirtseff, a labor of love by dedicated scholars working from the original manuscripts.

### Hardly anyone knows her.

The old, censored version remains what most people find. The complete French edition was published in limited runs, never widely distributed. The Cercle has largely disbanded. One person is working on a Spanish translation. An English translation by Katherine Kernberger exists (_[I Am the Most Interesting Book of All](https://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/linfauth/42/)_, 2013) — translated from the uncensored original after decades of research — but it is necessarily abridged, a selection from the vast whole.

No one has yet made Marie's _complete_ diary available, not to mention in multiple languages, using modern tools to help readers understand her world.

Marie wanted above all for the world to know her from her diary — as complete as she could capture.

> _"Que l'on ne change rien."_
>
> (Let nothing be changed.)

For over a century, we failed her. But today, we have unprecedented tools to change that. AI-assisted translation makes it possible to offer _everything_ and let readers decide whether to delve or skim. The devoted can follow every entry; others can discover the highlights that resonate most.

## What We're Building

**Bashkirtseff** is a project to bring Marie's complete, uncensored voice to the world.

We are just begin with free (as in open-source, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licensed) full original transcript, and build annotations and research. They will also serve well because we're planning on making Marie's diary accessible in languages beyond French. But translation is just the start.

The vision:

- **Complete texts** in multiple languages, freely accessible
- **Her art** alongside her words — she wanted to be known as a painter
- **Her world** photos and maps of the places she lived and traveled, historical context for the people and events she mentions
- **Scholarly apparatus** — glossary, historical context, research — so readers can explore and grasp her world
- **Modern formats** — let it be a website that is also an 'app', without ads or tracking, audio — because she wanted _everyone_, not just academics
- **Open source tools** — so anyone can contribute to bringing Marie to their language

If this grows into something larger, a revival of interest in Marie, a community, perhaps an organization, so be it. She would approve.

## Guiding Principles

These principles are derived from Marie's own words and values:

### 1. Completeness

> _"Que l'on ne change rien."_

We publish the full, uncensored text. Her contradictions, her vanity, her flaws, her brilliance — all of it. No sanitizing for modern sensibilities. Marie wanted to be known as she was.

### 2. Accessibility

Marie wanted the _world_ to know her, not just French aristocrats or academic specialists.

- Multiple languages
- Free access (ad-supported or donation-based)
- Modern formats people actually use
- Clear, quality translations that preserve her voice

### 3. Seriousness

> _"Si j'avais été un homme, j'aurais conquis l'Europe."_
>
> (If I had been a man, I would have conquered Europe.)

Marie wanted to be taken seriously — as a thinker, artist, and writer. We provide scholarly context: who were these people she mentions? What was happening in 1879? What does this French idiom mean?

The glossary, the research, the careful translation — these honor her demand to be treated as significant.

### 4. Women's Voices

Marie's diary is a feminist document, whether she would have used that word or not. She insisted that a woman's inner life was as rich, complex, and worthy of attention as any man's.

> _"Je suis mon propre héros."_
>
> (I am my own hero.)

We frame her work as an important piece of women's history — a young woman's intellectual and emotional life, preserved in extraordinary detail, from an era that dismissed such things as trivial.

### 5. Artistic Context

Marie wanted to be remembered as a painter. The diary overshadowed her art — but we don't have to perpetuate that.

We include her paintings. We discuss her artistic development, her studies, her Salon submissions. The diary is her masterpiece, but it's not the only thing she created.

### 6. Transparency

Marie was radically honest — about herself, her motives, her contradictions. We follow her example.

- Open source methodology
- Clear about translation choices
- Honest about limitations and tensions
- The project itself is as transparent as her diary

## How Marie Speaks

We don't pretend to channel Marie or simulate her as a chatbot. That would be undignified — a parlor trick unworthy of her.

Instead, Marie speaks through:

**Her actual words** — epigraphs, quotes, excerpts woven throughout. She wrote beautifully; we let her writing carry the weight.

**The editorial framework** — decisions are grounded in her stated wishes. "Marie asked that nothing be altered. We honor that by..."

**Thematic collections** — her thoughts on ambition, love, art, mortality, being a woman — organized so modern readers can engage with her ideas.

**The diary itself** — the primary work. Everything else serves to bring readers to her words, not to replace them.

She wanted to exist. She does — in 100 volumes of her own handwriting. Our job is to make sure people can read them.

## Honest Tensions

We don't pretend this is simple. There are genuine tensions to navigate:

### Marie's vanity and class consciousness

She was honestly vain, sometimes snobbish, a product of her aristocratic world. We don't sanitize this, but we provide context. Readers can engage with a complex human, not a saint.

### Artist vs. Diarist

She wanted fame as a painter; the diary eclipsed her art. There's irony here — she achieved immortality, just not how she planned. We honor both: the diary _is_ her masterpiece, but we include her paintings and discuss her as an artist.

### Performance vs. Authenticity

She knew she was writing for posterity. Some entries are more performative than others. This doesn't make them less true — she was honest about her performance. The artifice is part of the authenticity.

### Youth frozen in time

Marie died at 25. She never evolved into a mature adult with revised views. We don't condescend, but we acknowledge: these are a young person's thoughts, with all the intensity and limitations that implies. Her youth is part of her value — she captures something about being young, ambitious, and burning with unfulfilled potential.

### Historical distance

She lived in a different world with different assumptions. Some things she wrote may jar modern readers. We provide context without apologizing. She was of her time — and also remarkably ahead of it in many ways.

## How to Participate

Marie wanted the world to know her. You can help.

### Translate

The core work is translation. We have tools, methodology, and source texts. If you can translate from French to another language — or want to help improve existing translations — there's work to do.

### Research

Every entry references people, places, events, cultural context. The glossary needs expansion. Historical research makes the diary accessible.

### Read

Sometimes the most valuable thing is simply to read — to be one more person who knows Marie. To share a passage that struck you. To prove that she achieved what she wanted: existence in the minds of others.

### Contribute technically

The project uses modern tools — AI-assisted translation, web applications, open source infrastructure. Developers, designers, and technologists can help build the platforms that bring Marie to readers.

### Spread the word

Marie craved fame. Tell people about her. Share her words. Link to her paintings. Every person who discovers Marie is a small victory against the obscurity she feared.

## The Name

Working name: **Bashkirtseff**

Possible final names:

- **The Bashkirtseff Project** — clear, searchable, serious
- **Je Veux Exister** — her own words: "I want to exist"

For now, we simply use her name. It's what she would have wanted.

> _"La plus grande crainte que j'aie, c'est de ne point laisser de traces de mon existence."_
>
> (The greatest fear I have is to leave no trace of my existence.)

She left traces. 100 volumes of them. Our job is to make sure the world can read them.

## Join Us

This is an open project. The source texts, translation tools, and methodology are available. Marie wanted everyone to know her — and now, for the first time, everyone can help make that happen.
