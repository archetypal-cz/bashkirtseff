# Marie Bashkirtseff: Homecoming

For over a century, the world knew her as a French diarist. But Mariya Kostyantynivna Bashkirtseva was born November 24, 1858, in Gavrontsi, near Poltava—in the heart of Ukraine. She was Ukrainian, and no distance, no language, no century can change that.

## Who She Was

Marie Bashkirtseff was extraordinary by any measure:

- A **polyglot** who mastered French, Russian, Italian, German, Latin, and Greek
- A **painter** whose work hangs in the Musée d'Orsay
- A **feminist voice** who corresponded with Guy de Maupassant and championed women's access to art education
- A **writer** whose diary—over 100 notebooks spanning 12 years—is one of the most intimate self-portraits in literature

She was ambitious, brilliant, vain, insecure, passionate, and utterly honest about all of it. She wanted glory. She wanted to be remembered. She wrote:

> *"If I do not die young, I hope to remain in history as a great artist; but if I die young, I want my diary to be published."*

She died of tuberculosis at 25. The diary was published—but heavily censored, with thousands of pages suppressed. The full Marie was hidden for over a century.

## A Citizen of the World with Ukrainian Roots

Marie was not a nationalist—she was too ambitious for any borders. She wrote in French because that was the language of European culture. She lived in Nice, Rome, Paris. She wanted to conquer the world.

But roots don't disappear. In her diary, she writes of "our estates" near Poltava, of family history, of a connection no one can sever.

One can be a citizen of the world and still belong to the land of one's origin. Marie was both.

## What Was Lost

After Marie's death at 25, the diary was published—but brutally censored. Thousands of pages removed. The true, complex, living Marie was hidden.

The uncensored manuscripts survived. Le Cercle des amis de Marie Bashkirtseff published a complete French transcription between 1995 and 2005. But translations into other languages—including Ukrainian—have remained incomplete or nonexistent.

## What This Project Is

This is an experiment: one person with AI assistance, building scaffolding for translating Marie's complete diary into multiple languages.

AI agents do most of the heavy lifting. Humans provide intent, prompts, and course corrections. It's scrappy, not scholarly—"let's see if we can get a working first draft" rather than careful review of every sentence.

We don't know if this will work at scale. But the infrastructure exists, the methodology is open, and anyone can build on it.

## What's Available Now

- **The complete, mostly French originals**, structured and searchable in a simple, non-tracking web app at bashkirtseff.org
- **Paragraph-level alignment** across all 107 notebooks
- **A growing glossary** of people, places, and cultural references
- **Translations emerging** as the pipeline processes entries
- **Open source infrastructure** for others to fork and extend

You can read Marie's original words today, right now, for free.

## What We Offer Ukraine

This is not a prescription for who Marie is to Ukraine. It's a gift.

We are working to restore her voice. We are translating her words. We are documenting every detail.

What you do with this is yours to decide.

Perhaps she becomes a symbol of Ukrainian women who conquered the world. Perhaps an example that Ukrainians have always been Europeans. Perhaps simply a captivating voice from the past.

This is your great-grandmother. You decide what place she holds in your home.

## The Invitation

- **To Ukrainian scholars**: Help research, annotate, add context
- **To translators**: Join the experiment—Ukrainian translation is underway
- **To readers**: The originals are there; the translations are coming
- **To the technically curious**: Fork it, improve it, adapt it

This is one person's project with AI assistance. If you'd like to accelerate the work, you can sponsor the project or contribute your own Claude MAX subscription to the effort.
