# Czech Grammar Guidelines for Translation

This document provides essential Czech grammar guidelines for translators working on the Marie Bashkirtseff diary project. It focuses on aspects particularly relevant to literary translation from French to Czech.

## General Principles

As outlined in prompts/Style.cz.md, we aim for a translation that:
- Uses modern Czech but with a slightly archaic feel
- Follows Czech punctuation rules
- Provides explanations for concepts that may be unfamiliar to Czech readers
- Captures the spirit of the original while sounding natural in Czech

## Punctuation

### Quotation Marks
- Use Czech-style quotation marks: „text" (opening at the bottom, closing at the top)
- For quotes within quotes, use »text«

### Date Formatting
- Use Czech date format: day.month.year (e.g., 26.1.1873)
- When mentioning only day and month in text, use: 26. ledna

### Other Punctuation
- Use Czech-style decimal comma (not period): 3,14
- Use spaces with thousands separator: 10 000 (not 10,000)
- Em-dash usage should follow Czech conventions with spaces on both sides: text — text

## Verb Tenses

### Past Tense
- Use past tense forms appropriate to the narrative context
- Be mindful of aspect (perfective vs. imperfective) to convey the right sense of completed or ongoing actions
- Example: "Je suis allée" → "Šla jsem" (imperfective) or "Zašla jsem" (perfective)

### Present Tense
- When Marie writes in present tense for immediacy, maintain this in Czech
- Pay attention to aspect in present tense as well

## Noun Cases

- Ensure proper declension of names and places according to Czech grammar
- Foreign names should be declined according to Czech patterns when established
- For less common foreign names, use appropriate declension patterns based on ending sounds

## Pronouns

- Czech often omits personal pronouns when the subject is clear from context
- Use pronouns for emphasis or clarity when needed
- Pay attention to T-V distinction (tykání/vykání) based on the relationship between speakers

## Archaic Elements

As noted in Style.cz.md, we want a slightly archaic feel while remaining accessible:

- Occasional use of older verb forms (e.g., "byl bych býval" instead of modern "byl bych")
- Some archaic vocabulary where appropriate, but not to the point of obscurity
- Slightly more formal sentence structures than contemporary Czech

## Cultural Adaptations

- French titles of nobility should use Czech equivalents: duc → vévoda, comte → hrabě
- French cultural references should be explained in translator's notes when necessary
- French expressions can sometimes be kept in original with translation in footnotes if they add period flavor

## Common Translation Challenges

### Gendered Language
- French has grammatical gender that sometimes carries meaning; ensure this is conveyed appropriately in Czech

### Idiomatic Expressions
- Translate the meaning rather than word-for-word
- Find Czech equivalents that convey the same feeling and era

### Terms of Endearment
- Use period-appropriate Czech terms of endearment rather than translating French ones directly

## Notes Format

As specified in Style.cz.md, use these prefixes for notes:
- Pozn. aut.: Author's notes
- Pozn. překl.: Translator's notes
- Pozn. red.: Editor's notes
