## Biographical Overview

**Marie Bashkirtseff** (born Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva; 24 November 1858 – 31 October 1884) was a Ukrainian-born painter, sculptor, diarist, and proto-feminist who lived and worked primarily in Paris. She died of tuberculosis at age 25, but left behind one of the most influential personal documents of the 19th century.

Born in Gavrontsi (Havrontsi) near [Poltava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff), Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), to a wealthy noble family. Her father Konstantin Pavlovich Bashkirtsev was a local marshal of nobility; her mother Maria Stepanovna Babanina also belonged to Russian nobles.

The family was described as "somewhat nomadic and eccentric" with a history of "petite noblesse" ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884)).

## The Diary: A Literary Revolution

### Publication and Initial Reception

Marie Bashkirtseff's diary was published posthumously in 1887 and achieved immediate critical and commercial success. It was **only the second diary by a woman published in France** to that date—the first being Eugénie de Guérin's contemplative, mystical diary published in 1862 ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/)).

Her "cosmopolitan confessional style was a marked departure" from the introspective religious diaries that preceded her. The diary was revolutionary in its raw ambition, self-analysis, and refusal to conform to expectations of feminine modesty ([Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/marie-bashkirtseff/)).

### Notable Early Admirers

- **William Gladstone**, British Prime Minister, called her journal "a book without a parallel" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff))
- **George Bernard Shaw** was an early admirer ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/))
- **George Gissing**, the late 19th-century English novelist, read the original French version over eight days in June 1890 ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/))

### The Censorship Problem

The published diary was heavily manipulated. As scholars have documented:

> "The diary, published posthumously in 1887, was expurgated, sanitized, and denuded. Marie's mother made sure that none of her daughter's more radical opinions—and more importantly, their strange family history—appeared in the diary's pages." ([Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/marie-bashkirtseff/))

Despite this censorship:

> "It was hailed as the true portrait of a woman by the French press, and Bashkirtseff was alternately canonized as a misunderstood genius and damned as a self-absorbed misfit." ([Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/marie-bashkirtseff/))

### Restoration of the Original Text

**Katherine Kernberger** dedicated decades to restoring the authentic diary from Marie's original notebooks held at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France:

> "Her meticulous, decades-long research into Marie's life has resurrected the true, multifaceted literary self-portrait that Marie Bashkirtseff endeavored to reveal." ([Fonthill Press](http://www.fonthillpress.com/TheJournalsofMarieBashkirtseff/Book_Summary_MarieBashkirtseff.html))

The translator **Phyllis Howard Kernberger** (Katherine's mother), a retired English teacher, began the work but died in 1991. Katherine continued her mother's commitment to providing an uncensored, "true" translation ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19302622-the-journal-of-marie-bashkirtseff)).

**Published editions of the restored diary:**
- *I Am the Most Interesting Book of All: The Diary of Marie Bashkirtseff, Vol. 1* (1997)
- *Lust for Glory: The Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff, Vol. 2* (2013)

The original manuscript comprised some **20,000 hand-written pages** ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884)).

## Literary Influence and Legacy

### The Birth of Confessional Diary Writing

Marie Bashkirtseff's diary established a new genre of personal writing:

> "Her signature writing style, which allows readers to accompany her on a psychological journey during which she experiences intellectual and artistic enlightenment, inspired future writers, who also turned to their journals as creative outlets for stormy feelings." ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/))

### Writers Directly Influenced

#### Anaïs Nin (1903-1977)
The serial diarist who documented her life across bohemian Paris was directly inspired by Bashkirtseff. As Deirdre Bair, Nin's biographer, states:

> "In all likelihood 'Marie's journal first gave [Nin] the idea that she, too, should write for posterity and, therefore, eventual publication.'" ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884))

#### Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923)
The New Zealand writer "whose journals were a place of solace in a short, often lonely life, was among her admirers" and cited Bashkirtseff as a model for her own diary writing ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/)).

#### W.N.P. Barbellion (1889-1919)
Author of *The Journal of a Disappointed Man*, another confessional diary by a young person dying of chronic illness, cited Bashkirtseff as an influence ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff)).

#### Mary MacLane (1881-1929)
American writer whose "shockingly confessional diary was written a bare generation later" explicitly cited Bashkirtseff's diary as an inspiration ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/)).

#### Pierre Louÿs (1870-1925)
The French poet and novelist mentioned Bashkirtseff's diary as a model for his own writing ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff)).

#### Paula Modersohn-Becker (1876-1907)
The German Expressionist painter "admired and hoped to emulate the young Russian's accomplishments" ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884)).

### Scholarly Assessment of Literary Significance

Art education scholar **Enid Zimmerman** notes:

> "Bashkirtseff's journal 'is an example of a diary written by a woman in her adolescent years and early adulthood, in the mode of self-presentation, concentrating on explicating details of her most personal life.'" ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/))

Scholar **Sonia Wilson** proposes that Bashkirtseff's diary was:

> "Important in developing the concept of adolescence" and represents "one of the earliest bids by a woman to secure celebrity through curation of 'personal brand.'" ([Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/marie-bashkirtseff/))

### Cultural Impact

> "Marie Bashkirtseff quickly became a myth and inspired generations of young girls." ([Presses universitaires de Rennes](https://books.openedition.org/pur/255158?lang=en))

The diary spawned plays and films based on her life, including *The Affairs of Maupassant*, directed by Henry Koster (released in the United States in 1938) ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/)).

## Feminist Significance

### Simone de Beauvoir and *The Second Sex*

**Simone de Beauvoir** (1908-1986) used Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a **major source for *The Second Sex*** (1949), her groundbreaking study of women's psychology and social conditioning:

> "She found the young Russian's writing an important illustration of the narcissistic thinking and behavior society imposes on females. Beauvoir cited diary passages in which Bashkirtseff repeatedly expressed her need to be admired by others, her sense of constantly being on a stage." ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884))

But Beauvoir was equally interested in Marie's resistance:

> "Beauvoir was equally interested in how Bashkirtseff, once committed to her life as an artist, expressed outrage and struggled against the social and professional restrictions placed upon her by her identity as a woman." ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884))

Beauvoir saw in Marie's journal "a model of the genre" ([Presses universitaires de Rennes](https://books.openedition.org/pur/255158?lang=en)).

### Feminist Journalism

Marie wrote for **Hubertine Auclert's feminist newspaper *La Citoyenne*** in 1881 under the pseudonym **"Pauline Orrel"** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff)).

### Articulating Women's Constraints

Her diary captured the frustrations of talented women in the 19th century with remarkable clarity:

> "She chafed at being barred from the École des Beaux-Arts, and she was outraged at her inability to go unaccompanied to visit the Louvre." ([Clark Art Institute](https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/women-artists-in-paris/about-the-artists/marie-bashkirtseff))

Her famous lament:

> **"I know that I should become somebody; but with skirts—what can one do?"** ([Clark Art Institute](https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/women-artists-in-paris/about-the-artists/marie-bashkirtseff))

### Scholarly Recognition

In their introduction to the 1985 edition of her diary, feminist art historians **Roszika Parker and Griselda Pollock** wrote:

> "Never before had a woman so urgently proclaimed her ambition to excel, her hunger for public fame." ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884))

They emphasized "the constraints she suffered as a female artist, and her role in militant socialist and feminist circles in Paris in the early 1880s" ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884)).

### Understanding Women's Art Education

> "Marie Bashkirtseff's diary served as a particular instance to explain the way women art students were viewed and the type of education they received in 19th-century France. It was concluded that women art students suffered societal constraints and were not best served in respect to their art education." ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290777245_The_Mirror_of_Marie_Bashkirtseff_Reflections_about_the_Education_of_Women_Art_Students_in_the_Nineteenth_Century))

## Artistic Career and Legacy

### Training at the Académie Julian

Marie had originally dreamed of becoming an opera singer, but tuberculosis altered her mezzo-soprano voice. She enrolled at the **Académie Julian** in Paris in 1877, one of the few establishments that accepted female students ([Clark Art Institute](https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/women-artists-in-paris/about-the-artists/marie-bashkirtseff)).

> "The Académie, as one of the few establishments that accepted female students, attracted young women from all over Europe and the United States." ([AWARE Women Artists](https://awarewomenartists.com/en/artiste/marie-bashkirtseff/))

Her teachers included:
- **Rodolphe Julian** (founder)
- **Tony Robert-Fleury**
- **Gustave Boulanger**
- **Jules-Joseph Lefebvre**

([AWARE Women Artists](https://awarewomenartists.com/en/artiste/marie-bashkirtseff/))

### Major Works

#### *L'Atelier Julian* (The Julian Studio)
Commissioned by Rodolphe Julian himself, this painting depicted artists at work in his academy:

> "One painting by Marie Bashkirtseff which came about during her time at the Académie Julian was commissioned by Rodolphe Julian. He asked her to paint a canvas depicting the artists at work in his academy. The finished canvas was entitled *L'Atelier Julian* and is now looked upon as one of Bashkirtseff's finest works." ([My Daily Art Display](https://mydailyartdisplay.uk/tag/atelier-julian-by-marie-bashkirtseff/))

#### *The Meeting* (*Un Meeting*), 1884

Her masterpiece, now at the **Musée d'Orsay** in Paris:

> "Her painting 'The Meeting' (1884), displayed in Musée D'Orsay, is renowned for its intricate portrayal of a group of children and is celebrated as a masterwork of Realism." ([Clark Art Institute](https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/women-artists-in-paris/about-the-artists/marie-bashkirtseff))

The painting depicts six young boys from working-class families gathered on a street corner:

> "Before us are six young boys, who stand in a circle fascinated with what the tallest boy has in his hand. Whatever it is, it has them deep in discussion. Some still wear their school smocks. The shabbiness of their clothes and shoes marks them as coming from poor working-class families, and the setting is a run-down working class area." ([My Daily Art Display](https://mydailyartdisplay.uk/tag/the-meeting-by-marie-bashkirtseff/))

### Artistic Philosophy: Urban Naturalism

Marie consciously took the naturalist movement to urban settings, where her mentor Jules Bastien-Lepage focused on rural subjects:

> "Where Bastien-Lepage had found his inspiration in nature, Bashkirtseff turned to the urban scene, writing, 'I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien.'" ([Obelisk Art History](https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/marie-bashkirtseff/the-meeting/))

### Reception of Her Art

*The Meeting* was exhibited at the 1884 Salon:

> "It was an enormous success, both with the press and public alike. However, much to Bashkirtseff's annoyance, her painting was not awarded a medal." ([My Daily Art Display](https://mydailyartdisplay.uk/tag/the-meeting-by-marie-bashkirtseff/))

A bittersweet moment at the exhibition:

> "At the opening she overheard someone say, 'There's a very good Bastien-Lepage in there signed Bashkirtseff.'" ([My Daily Art Display](https://mydailyartdisplay.uk/tag/the-meeting-by-marie-bashkirtseff/))

Both Bashkirtseff and Bastien-Lepage died of chronic illness in the same year, 1884. The later pages of her journal record her visits to the dying painter ([AWARE Women Artists](https://awarewomenartists.com/en/artiste/marie-bashkirtseff/)).

### Surviving Works

> "Although a large number of Bashkirtseff's works were destroyed by the Nazis during World War II, at least 60 survive." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff))

Her work *In the Studio* (1881) is held at the Dnipropetrovsk State Art Museum in Ukraine ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bashkirtseff)).

### Place in Art History

In 1937, an exhibition of women artists of Europe was held at the **Jeu de Paume** in Paris and later at the **Metropolitan Museum of Art** in New York:

> "There were 550 works from 15 countries, and the retrospective section contained works by Marie Bashkirtseff, as well as Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, and others." ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884))

In 2000, a U.S. touring exhibition entitled **"Overcoming All the Obstacles: The Women of Academy Julian"** featured works by Bashkirtseff and her schoolmates ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bashkirtseff-marie-1859-1884)).

### Ranking Among Ukrainian Artists

> "Marie Bashkirtseff is the 285th most popular painter, the 87th most popular biography from Ukraine, and the 5th most popular Ukrainian Painter." ([Pantheon](https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Marie_Bashkirtseff/))

She ranks 5th among Ukrainian painters, after Kazimir Malevich, Ilya Repin, Ivan Aivazovsky, and Sonia Delaunay ([Pantheon](https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Marie_Bashkirtseff/)).

## Memorialization and Cultural Heritage

### The Tomb at Passy Cemetery

Marie Bashkirtseff's tomb at **Passy Cemetery** in Paris is extraordinary:

> "Her monument is a full-sized artist studio that has been declared a historic monument by the government of France." ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/))

> "The tomb of the impressionist Russian painter Marie Bashkirtseff is a lesser-known surprise at the Passy Cemetery. The tomb is a recreated art studio, not a typical religious monument." ([Travel France Online](https://www.travelfranceonline.com/cimetiere-de-passy-paris-16th-district/))

The tomb is located in the 11th division of Passy Cemetery ([Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-visit-in-paris/history-heritage/articles/327783-who-is-buried-at-the-passy-cemetery-the-celebrities-buried-there-and-their-locations)).

### Early Pilgrimage Site

As early as 1892, visitors were making pilgrimages to her grave. A contemporary account states:

> "Yesterday I went out to the pretty cemetery of Passy to see the grave of the eccentric Marie Bashkirtseff." ([Trove - 1892 newspaper](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19005138))

### Other Memorials

### Ukrainian Cultural Significance

> "Today, as Ukraine reassesses her own legacy and bids for greater cultural recognition by other nations, a closer appreciation of Marie Bashkirtseff's background reveals a unique synergy of Ukrainian and French culture." ([Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/25715232/MARIE_BASHKIRTSEFF_Ukraines_cultural_ambassador_to_nineteenth_century_France_Cultural_Diplomacy_feature_Business_Ukraine_Magazine_March_2016_))

## Summary of Historical Significance

Marie Bashkirtseff's importance spans multiple domains:

1. **Literary History**: Pioneer of confessional diary writing; direct influence on Anaïs Nin, Katherine Mansfield, and others
2. **Feminist History**: Major source for Simone de Beauvoir's *The Second Sex*; activist writing for *La Citoyenne*
3. **Art History**: Naturalist painter; *The Meeting* at Musée d'Orsay; pioneer among women artists at Académie Julian
4. **Cultural History**: Helped develop the modern concept of adolescence; early example of personal brand curation; tomb is French historic monument
5. **Ukrainian Heritage**: 5th most celebrated Ukrainian painter; cultural ambassador

Her lasting impact is perhaps best summarized:

> "Although her painting did not leave a lasting mark, Marie Bashkirtseff's writing won her an important place in the world of 19th-century letters." ([JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/marie-bashkirtseffs-diary/))

Yet her painting *did* leave a mark—*The Meeting* remains at the Musée d'Orsay, and her role in the women's art movement continues to be studied and exhibited.
