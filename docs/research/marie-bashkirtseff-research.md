- Parents separated when Marie was two years old

- Family scandals included a controversial trial in Russia involving Marie's mother and aunt, accused of colluding in the death of a relative's husband (they were cleared but the scandal persisted)
- Grew up mostly abroad, traveling through Europe with her mother, with longer stays in Germany and on the Riviera before settling in Paris

- Received honorable mention at the 1884 Salon for her pastel portrait of her cousin

#### Artistic Style

- Mentored by Jules Bastien-Lepage, leader of the naturalist movement
- While Bastien-Lepage focused on rural subjects, Bashkirtseff pioneered urban naturalism
- Her famous statement: "I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien."

### The History of Her Diary

#### Original Manuscript

- Written from 1873 (age 14) until her death in 1884
- Comprises 105-106 numbered notebooks and carnets
- Approximately 19,000-20,000 handwritten pages
- Currently preserved at the Manuscripts Department of the Bibliotheque nationale de France
- Written primarily in French with some entries in Russian, English, and Italian

#### First Publication (1887) - Censored Edition

- Published as *Journal de Marie Bashkirtseff* (Paris: Charpentier, 1887, 2 volumes)
- Edited by Andre Theuriet, a popular poet and novelist
- Only the second diary by a woman published in France (after Eugenie de Guerin's in 1862)
- Achieved immediate critical and commercial success

**Nature of the Censorship**:
- Marie's mother enlisted Andre Theuriet to prepare the manuscript
- Theuriet "deleted, condensed, and sequenced entries to produce an overarching narrative arc"
- The first publication included only approximately a quarter of the original diaries
- All references to family scandals and the Russian trial were removed
- Descriptions of her body were deleted
- Two years were removed from her age (changed from 1858 to 1860 birth date)
- "Radical opinions" and "strange family history" were expurgated

**Early Reception**:
- British Prime Minister William Gladstone called it "a book without a parallel"
- George Bernard Shaw was an early admirer
- Hailed as "the true portrait of a woman" by the French press

#### Later Editions and Restoration

**Pierre Borel editions**: Published various fragments periodically, including *Le Visage Inconnu* (Garnier, 1925)

**Letters published separately**:
- *Lettres de Marie Bashkirtseff* - correspondence with Guy de Maupassant (began March 1884, under an assumed name)
- First published in 1891

### Connection to Feminism and Women's Rights

#### Association with Hubertine Auclert

- Hubertine Auclert (1848-1914) founded the feminist movement Le Droit des Femmes in 1876
- Auclert launched *La Citoyenne*, a monthly feminist newspaper, on 13 February 1881
- Marie Bashkirtseff wrote articles for *La Citoyenne* under the pseudonym "Pauline Orrel"
- In March 1881, she published an article linking her artistic career with women's struggle, cynically noting: "I will not surprise anyone by saying that women are excluded from the School of Fine Arts as they are almost everywhere."

#### Feminist Art and Writing

- Her 1880 painting *Jeune femme lisant la Question du Divorce d'Alexandre Dumas* (Young woman reading) carried a feminist message about intelligent women
- Famous lament from her diary: "I know that I should become somebody; but with skirts - what can one do?"
- Chafed at being barred from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts
- Outraged at her inability to go unaccompanied to visit the Louvre

#### Influence on Feminist Thought

**Simone de Beauvoir and *The Second Sex* (1949)**:
- Beauvoir used Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a major source for *The Second Sex*
- Found her writing "an important illustration of the narcissistic thinking and behavior society imposes on females"
- Equally interested in how Bashkirtseff "expressed outrage and struggled against the social and professional restrictions placed upon her"
- Quoted the eighteen-year-old Bashkirtseff: "The closer I come to the old age of my youth, the more indifferent I become. Few things excite me now, whereas everything used to excite me."

#### Literary Influence

Writers directly inspired by Bashkirtseff's diary:
- **Anais Nin** (1903-1977) - Her diary inspired Nin to "write for posterity and, therefore, eventual publication"
- **Katherine Mansfield** (1888-1923) - New Zealand writer whose journals were a place of solace
- **Mary MacLane** (1881-1929) - H.L. Mencken dubbed her "the Butte Bashkirtseff"
- **W.N.P. Barbellion** (1889-1919) - Author of *The Journal of a Disappointed Man*
- **Paula Modersohn-Becker** (1876-1907) - German Expressionist painter who "admired and hoped to emulate" her
