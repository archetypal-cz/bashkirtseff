# Stewardship

> *"Que l'on ne change rien."*

We're not marketing a product. We're stewarding a legacy.

Marie Bashkirtseff wanted witnesses to her existence. For over a century, the world was given only a sanitized version of her. Now, for the first time, we have the tools to share her complete voice — in multiple languages, freely accessible.

Our role is to **bear witness and invite others to witness**.

## The Core Narrative

A woman who desperately wanted to be remembered was censored by her own family. For 140 years, the world knew only a sanitized version. Now, AI-assisted translation is restoring her complete voice — and doing so transparently, ethically, letting Marie remain the protagonist.

This is not about AI. This is about Marie. AI is the humble translator, the research assistant, the tireless worker who enables Marie to speak across languages and centuries.

## Principles

### 1. The Human Voice Is Sovereign

AI serves to transmit, never to transform or simulate the human voice.

- Translation preserves Marie's voice; AI is the translator, not the author
- We never create chatbots or simulations ("Ask Marie")
- Summaries always lead to full text, never replace it
- The original is always included alongside any interpretation

Marie wrote to exist in her own words. Using AI to put words in her mouth would be erasure dressed as puppeteering.

### 2. Marie Speaks First

Her words are the content. We don't paraphrase, we don't summarize, we don't interpret. We share her actual words and let them do the work.

Every piece of content should feature Marie's voice, with context serving her words rather than replacing them.

### 3. Completeness — Let Nothing Be Changed

We publish the full, uncensored text. Her contradictions, her vanity, her flaws, her brilliance — all of it. No sanitizing for modern sensibilities. Marie wanted to be known as she was.

We do not:
- Edit Marie's text for modern sensibilities
- Sanitize views that jar contemporary readers
- Soften her vanity or ambition
- Make her more palatable

### 4. Transparency Is Non-Negotiable

The project's transparency matches Marie's radical honesty about herself.

- Methodology is public
- Translation workflow is documented and auditable down to git commits
- AI-generated content is identified as such
- Research sources are cited
- Limitations are acknowledged

This isn't just ethical — it's strategically differentiating. We're setting norms for how AI can be used in cultural restoration.

### 5. AI Enables Scale, Not Quality Shortcuts

AI allows us to do more, not to do less carefully.

- Multi-stage process with several review rounds
- Each AI role has defined responsibilities and quality standards
- Human oversight at key decision points
- No entry marked complete without full review chain

AI could translate all 3,300 entries in days. That would dishonor Marie. Scale is meaningful only if quality is maintained at every step.

### 6. The Dead Cannot Consent, So We Must Be Careful

When representing someone who cannot speak for themselves, err toward their expressed wishes.

**What we know she wanted:**
- To be read
- To be remembered
- To be taken seriously
- To have nothing changed

**What we don't presume:**
- Her opinions on topics she never addressed
- How she would feel about specific modern issues
- "What Marie would think" about anything not in her diary

### 7. Credit the Chain of Transmission

1. **Marie Bashkirtseff** wrote the diary
2. **Her family** preserved it (though censored it)
3. **Ginette Apostolescu** and the **Cercle des Amis** transcribed the complete originals over years of work
4. **Katherine Kernberger** spent decades producing a scholarly English translation
5. **This project** uses AI to research, annotate, translate and make accessible

We don't claim to have "discovered" what others uncovered.

### 8. Open Methods Enable Others

Marie isn't the only voice censored or forgotten. If these methods help restore others, that multiplies the value of this work.

- Project is open source
- Translation workflow is documented
- Skills/prompts are shareable
- We want others to bring their historical voices back too

### 9. Mission Over Commerce

The goal is Marie's existence in human memory, not revenue.

- Translations are freely accessible online
- Open source tools
- If commercial elements exist (books, apps), they fund the mission
- Core work is never paywalled

Marie wanted everyone to know her. Restricting access to those who can pay would betray that wish.

## What We Won't Do

### No Marie Chatbots

We will never create "Chat with Marie" interfaces, AI trained to respond "as Marie," or simulated conversations with the dead. Marie exists in her own words. Putting words in her mouth is not preservation — it's ventriloquism.

### No Speculative Content

We will not create "What Marie would think about [modern topic]," stories about Marie doing things she didn't document, or "Marie's advice for..." content. We have 20,000 pages of what she actually wrote. That's enough.

### No Sensationalism

Marie wanted serious fame. She would despise being reduced to gossip. We don't emphasize scandals over substance, illness as spectacle, death as clickbait, or her personal life for voyeuristic appeal.

### No Uncredited AI

We will not present AI-generated text as human-written, hide the role of AI in translation, or obscure methodology.

---

## Edge Cases

### Offensive Content

Marie held some views typical of 19th-century aristocrats that modern readers may find objectionable. We translate faithfully, provide historical context where helpful, do not editorialize or apologize, and trust readers to engage with a complex human.

### Uncertain Translations

Some passages are ambiguous. We note uncertainty in translator comments, include original French for verification, prefer preserving ambiguity over false certainty, and document choices for future scholars.

### Privacy of Others

Marie wrote about real people, some harshly. These people have been dead for over a century. The original has been published in French. We translate what Marie wrote and provide context in the glossary.

---

## Seriousness Without Stuffiness

Marie wanted to be taken seriously. We provide scholarly context, careful translation, historical research.

But Marie was also dramatic, funny, self-aware, and young. We honor her full personality, not just her profundity.

Her diary is inherently feminist — a woman insisting her inner life was worth documenting, worth reading, worth remembering. We don't need to add feminist commentary; her words make the case.

---

## A Model for Others

We propose these norms not just for ourselves, but as a model for:

- Literary translation projects using AI assistance
- Historical preservation efforts using computational methods
- Cultural heritage digitization and accessibility
- Any project that uses AI to transmit human voices across time

We are at an inflection point. AI can now translate entire libraries, research historical figures at scale, generate content resembling human writing, create simulations of the dead. The question isn't whether this will happen, but how.

Marie Bashkirtseff wanted to exist. She wrote 20,000 pages to ensure it. Using AI to help her wish come true — while keeping her voice her own — is the ethical path forward.

> *"Je suis mon propre héros."*
> (I am my own hero.)

Marie Bashkirtseff was her own hero. AI won't change that. It will just help more people discover it.
