## The Question We're Answering

What does it mean to use artificial intelligence to restore a forgotten voice?

Marie Bashkirtseff wanted to be remembered. She wrote 20,000 pages to ensure it. Her family censored her. Time obscured her. Now AI makes it possible to translate, research, and share her complete voice at unprecedented scale.

This document articulates the norms we follow—and propose as standards for similar projects.

## Principles of AI-Assisted Cultural Stewardship

### 1. The Human Voice is Sovereign

**Norm**: AI serves to transmit, never to transform or simulate the human voice.

**In Practice**:
- Translation preserves Marie's voice; AI is the translator, not the author
- We never create chatbots or simulations ("Ask Marie!")
- Summaries always lead to full text, never replace it
- When uncertain, we include the original alongside any interpretation

**Why This Matters**:
Marie wrote to exist in her own words. Using AI to put words in her mouth would be the opposite of existence—it would be erasure dressed as preservation.

### 2. Transparency Is Non-Negotiable

**Norm**: Every use of AI is documented and discoverable.

**In Practice**:
- Methodology is public
- Translation workflow is documented
- AI-generated content is identified as such
- Research sources are cited
- Limitations are acknowledged

**Why This Matters**:
Marie practiced radical self-honesty. A project claiming to honor her cannot hide behind opacity. Future scholars must be able to understand exactly how this work was produced.

### 3. AI Enables Scale, Not Quality Shortcuts

**Norm**: AI allows us to do more, not to do less carefully.

**In Practice**:
- Multi-stage review (Researcher → Linguist → Translator → Editor → Conductor)
- Each AI role has defined responsibilities and quality standards
- Human oversight at key decision points
- No entry marked complete without review chain

**Why This Matters**:
AI could translate all 3,300 entries in days. That would dishonor Marie. The scale AI enables is meaningful only if quality is maintained at every step.

### 4. The Dead Cannot Consent, So We Must Be Careful

**Norm**: When representing someone who cannot speak for themselves, err toward their expressed wishes.

**In Practice**:
- Marie explicitly asked for her diary to be published complete ("Que l'on ne change rien")
- She wanted fame, recognition, to be taken seriously
- We honor these wishes while avoiding exploitation
- We don't speculate about what she "would have" thought about modern topics

**What We Know She Wanted**:
- To be read
- To be remembered
- To be taken seriously
- To have nothing changed

**What We Don't Presume**:
- Her opinions on topics she never addressed
- How she would feel about specific modern issues
- "What Marie would think" about anything not in her diary

### 5. Credit and Context Honor the Chain of Transmission

**Norm**: Acknowledge everyone who contributed to making this work possible.

**The Chain**:
1. **Marie Bashkirtseff** wrote the diary
2. **Her family** preserved it (though censored it)
3. **The Cercle des Amis** transcribed the complete originals
4. **Katherine Kernberger** spent decades producing a scholarly English translation
5. **This project** uses AI to translate further and make accessible

**In Practice**:
- Every significant document acknowledges the Cercle's foundational work
- Katherine Kernberger's scholarship is cited and respected
- The original manuscripts' location (BnF) is documented
- We don't claim to have "discovered" what others uncovered

### 6. Open Methods Enable Others

**Norm**: Share methodology so others can do similar work.

**In Practice**:
- Project is open source
- Translation workflow is documented
- Skills/prompts are shareable
- We want others to bring their historical voices back too

**Why This Matters**:
Marie isn't the only voice censored or forgotten. If our methods help restore others, that multiplies the value of this work.

### 7. Commercial Use Is Secondary to Mission

**Norm**: The goal is Marie's existence in human memory, not revenue.

**In Practice**:
- Translations are freely accessible online
- Open source tools
- If commercial elements exist (books, apps), they fund the mission
- Core work is never paywalled

**Why This Matters**:
Marie wanted everyone to know her. Restricting access to those who can pay would betray that wish.

## What We Won't Do

These practices are explicitly rejected:

### No Marie Chatbots

We will never create:
- "Chat with Marie" interfaces
- AI trained to respond "as Marie"
- Simulated conversations with the dead

Marie exists in her own words. Putting words in her mouth is not preservation—it's ventriloquism.

### No Speculative Content

We will not create:
- "What Marie would think about [modern topic]"
- Stories about Marie doing things she didn't document
- "Marie's advice for..." content

We have 20,000 pages of what she actually wrote. That's enough.

### No Sensationalism

We will not emphasize:
- Scandals over substance
- Illness as spectacle
- Death as clickbait
- Her personal life for voyeuristic appeal

Marie wanted serious fame. She would despise being reduced to gossip.

### No Uncredited AI

We will not:
- Present AI-generated text as human-written
- Hide the role of AI in translation
- Obscure methodology

### No "Improvements"

We will not:
- Edit Marie's text for modern sensibilities
- Sanitize views that jar contemporary readers
- Soften her vanity or ambition
- Make her more palatable

She asked that nothing be changed. We honor that.

## Edge Cases and How We Handle Them

### Offensive Content

Marie held some views typical of 19th-century aristocrats that modern readers may find objectionable.

**Our Approach**:
- Translate faithfully, including uncomfortable passages
- Provide historical context where helpful
- Do not editorialize or apologize
- Trust readers to engage with a complex human

### Uncertain Translations

Some passages are ambiguous. 19th-century French idioms don't always map cleanly.

**Our Approach**:
- Note uncertainty in translator comments
- Include original French for verification
- Prefer preserving ambiguity over false certainty
- Document translation choices for future scholars

### Privacy of Others

Marie wrote about real people, some harshly.

**Our Approach**:
- These people have been dead for over a century
- The original has been published in French
- We translate what Marie wrote
- We provide context in the glossary to help readers understand who these people were

### AI "Hallucinations"

AI can generate plausible-sounding false information.

**Our Approach**:
- Research phase verifies facts
- Multiple review stages catch errors
- Sources are cited for historical claims
- When uncertain, we say so

## A Model for Others

We propose these norms not just for ourselves, but as a model for:

- **Literary translation projects** using AI assistance
- **Historical preservation** efforts using computational methods
- **Cultural heritage** digitization and accessibility
- **Any project** that uses AI to transmit human voices across time

The principles are transferable:
1. The human voice is sovereign
2. Transparency is non-negotiable
3. AI enables scale, not shortcuts
4. Absent consent requires extra care
5. Credit the chain of transmission
6. Open methods multiply value
7. Mission over commerce

## Why This Matters Now

We are at an inflection point. AI can now:
- Translate entire libraries
- Research historical figures at scale
- Generate content resembling human writing
- Create simulations of the dead

The question isn't whether this will happen, but how. Projects like this one can establish norms that honor both the capabilities of AI and the dignity of the humans whose voices we seek to preserve.

Marie Bashkirtseff wanted to exist. She wrote 20,000 pages to ensure it. Using AI to help her wish come true—while keeping her voice her own—is the ethical path forward.

Others will follow. We're trying to show how it's done.

## Commitment

This project commits to:

1. Publishing this norms document publicly
2. Following these principles in practice
3. Acknowledging when we fall short and correcting course
4. Updating these norms as we learn
5. Engaging in good faith with those who question our approach

Marie was radically honest. A project in her name must be too.

Marie Bashkirtseff was her own hero. AI won't change that. It will just help more people discover it.
