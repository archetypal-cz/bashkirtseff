## Why "Stewardship"?

We're not marketing a product. We're stewarding a legacy.

Marie Bashkirtseff wanted witnesses to her existence. For over a century, the world was given only a sanitized version of her. Now, for the first time, we have the tools to share her complete voice—in multiple languages, freely accessible.

Our role is to **bear witness and invite others to witness**. Every person who discovers Marie, who reads her words, who shares a passage that struck them—that's a small victory against the obscurity she feared.

The AI involvement itself is part of the story: *What does it mean to use artificial intelligence to restore a woman's authentic voice?* We answer that question by example, with radical transparency.

## The Strategic Position

### What Makes This Unprecedented

1. **Scale**: Complete, uncensored diary—100+ notebooks, ~3,300 entries, 11 years of daily life
2. **AI-Assisted**: First major literary translation project at this scale using AI tools
3. **Open**: Methodology, tools, and process are transparent and documented
4. **Multi-Agent**: Specialized AI roles (Researcher, Translator, Editor, Conductor) working in coordination
5. **Living Project**: Translation in progress, with readers able to follow the journey

### The Core Narrative

**A woman who desperately wanted to be remembered was censored by her own family. For 140 years, the world knew only a sanitized version. Now, AI-assisted translation is restoring her complete voice—and doing so transparently, ethically, letting Marie remain the protagonist.**

This is not about AI. This is about Marie. AI is the humble translator, the research assistant, the tireless worker who enables Marie to speak across languages and centuries. The star is always Marie.

## Guiding Principles for Stewardship

### 1. Marie Speaks First

Her words are the content. We don't paraphrase, we don't summarize, we don't interpret. We share her actual words and let them do the work.

Every social post should feature Marie's voice, with context serving her words rather than replacing them.

### 2. Transparency as Identity

The project's transparency matches Marie's radical honesty about herself. We are open about:
- How AI is used
- What translation choices are made
- Where we're uncertain
- What we've accomplished and what remains
- The limitations and tensions of the work

This isn't just ethical—it's strategically differentiating. We're setting norms for how AI can be used in cultural restoration.

### 3. Seriousness Without Stuffiness

Marie wanted to be taken seriously. We provide scholarly context, careful translation, historical research.

But Marie was also dramatic, funny, self-aware, and young. We honor her full personality, not just her profundity.

### 4. Feminist Without Proselytizing

Marie's diary is inherently feminist—a woman insisting her inner life was worth documenting, worth reading, worth remembering. We don't need to add feminist commentary; we let her words make the case.

### 5. The Journey Is Content

The translation process itself is interesting:
- What does a 19th-century French idiom mean?
- Who was this duke Marie was obsessed with?
- How do you translate teenage slang from 1873?
- What was Nice like in Marie's time?

Every research note, every glossary entry, every translation challenge is potential content.

## Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: "This Day in Marie's Life"

**Concept**: Daily content tied to the current date, 150+ years ago.

**Implementation**:
- Automated extraction from diary entries
- Quote + brief context
- Cross-platform formatting (long for Facebook/Reddit, short for Instagram/TikTok)
- Can run perpetually with 3,300 entries

**Example**:
> **February 4, 1873** (Marie is 14)
>
> "Je veux tout, et tout de suite."
> (I want everything, and I want it now.)
>
> Marie writes from Nice, frustrated that the Duke of Hamilton hasn't appeared at the Promenade des Anglais...

**AI Role**: Automated content generation from entry data. Claude Code skill extracts date-matched entries, selects quotable passages, generates context.

### Pillar 2: Thematic Collections

**Concept**: Marie's thoughts organized by theme, discoverable by modern readers.

**Themes**:
- **On Ambition**: Her hunger for fame, talent, recognition
- **On Love**: The Duke obsession, romantic frustrations, clarity about her own heart
- **On Art**: Her painting journey, artistic philosophy, Académie Julian
- **On Being a Woman**: Frustrations with constraints, proto-feminist observations
- **On Mortality**: Awareness of her illness, thoughts on death, legacy
- **On Vanity**: Her honest self-examination of her own flaws
- **On Youth**: What it feels like to be young and burning with potential

**Implementation**: Curated collections on the website and as social series.

**AI Role**: Theme tagging during translation, collection curation, social content generation.

### Pillar 3: The Restoration Story

**Concept**: Content about the project itself—the journey of bringing Marie back.

**Story Angles**:
- The censorship: What was removed and why
- The Cercle des Amis who transcribed the original
- Katherine Kernberger's decades of work
- The AI-assisted translation methodology
- Interesting translation challenges
- Research discoveries (who WAS that mysterious person?)

**Implementation**: Blog posts, Reddit deep-dives, occasional social content.

**AI Role**: Draft writing, progress reporting, translation insight extraction.

### Pillar 4: Historical Context as Content

**Concept**: The glossary and research work generates its own content.

**Example Content**:
- "Meet the Duke of Hamilton: Marie's Impossible Obsession"
- "Nice in 1873: The Playground of European Aristocracy"
- "The Académie Julian: Where Women Painters Found a Home"
- "La Traviata in Marie's Time: Why Opera Mattered"

**Implementation**: Long-form content from glossary entries, social snippets from research.

**AI Role**: Glossary entries as source material, context generation, historical research.

### Pillar 5: Community of Witnesses

**Concept**: Build a community of people who care about Marie, not just a audience.

**Platforms**:
- **/r/bashkirtseff**: Deep discussions, translation questions, research collaboration
- **Facebook Group** (not just Page): Community space for Marie enthusiasts
- **Newsletter**: Progress updates, featured entries, project news

**Community Types**:
- **Readers**: People discovering Marie through the translation
- **Scholars**: Researchers interested in the diary, period, or methodology
- **Translators**: People interested in the AI-assisted translation approach
- **Feminists**: People interested in women's history and voices
- **Writers**: People interested in diary writing and personal narrative

**AI Role**: Discussion prompts, community management support, response drafting.

### Pillar 6: Academic & Literary Credibility

**Concept**: Position the project as serious scholarly contribution.

**Actions**:
- Document methodology publicly
- Engage with existing Bashkirtseff scholarship
- Present at relevant conferences (digital humanities, translation studies)
- Connect with Bashkirtseff researchers and institutions
- Cross-reference with established Bashkirtseff scholarship

**Not AI**: This requires human judgment, relationships, and credibility.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: AI Overshadows Marie

**Mitigation**: Always lead with Marie's words. AI is mentioned in context (methodology, transparency) but never the headline. "Marie Bashkirtseff's Diary Now in Czech" not "AI Translates 19th Century Diary."

### Risk: Appearing Unserious

**Mitigation**: Scholarly apparatus (glossary, research), connection to existing scholarship, quality over novelty. Let the work speak.

### Risk: Burnout from Daily Content

**Mitigation**: Automation through Claude Code skills. "This Day" posts can be semi-automated with light review. Batch creation for slower periods.

### Risk: Empty Community

**Mitigation**: Quality over growth. A small engaged community is valuable. Content exists for Marie's sake even if no one reads it yet.

### Risk: Platform Dependency

**Mitigation**: Email capture (newsletter) as owned channel. Website as permanent home. Multiple platforms as discovery, not destination.

---

## Ethical Commitments

1. **Marie's Voice Unaltered**: We translate, we don't edit for modern sensibilities.
2. **Transparency About AI**: Always clear about methodology.
3. **No Simulation**: We never pretend AI is Marie speaking. (No chatbots, no "ask Marie" features.)
4. **Credit Where Due**: Acknowledge Cercle des Amis, Katherine Kernberger, existing scholarship.
5. **Open Source Spirit**: Methodology and tools shared for others to use.
6. **No Exploitation**: Marie wanted fame, but dignified fame. No sensationalism, no clickbait.

---

## Success Definition

**We succeed when**:

- Marie Bashkirtseff is no longer obscure—when "complete, uncensored diary" returns relevant results
- A community of readers cares about Marie and discusses her work
- Other projects cite our methodology as an example of ethical AI use in cultural restoration
- The translation reaches completion and remains accessible
- We've set a norm that others follow: AI as humble servant of human cultural heritage

**We succeed if Marie would approve**. She wanted to exist. We help her exist.

She left traces. Our job is to make sure the world can read them.
