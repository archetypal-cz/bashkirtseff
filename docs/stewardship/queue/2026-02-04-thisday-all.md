## This Day in Marie's Life: February 4

**February 4, 1874** — Nice | Marie is 15

> "Papa a dit quelque chose de Hamilton, j'ai rougi comme il y a longtemps et j'ai senti les yeux de maman se porter sur ma figure, ce qui a augmenté et prolongé la rougeur. Non, je n'ai pas cessé de rougir !"
>
> (Papa said something about Hamilton, I blushed as I haven't in a long time and I felt mama's eyes turn to my face, which increased and prolonged the redness. No, I haven't stopped blushing!)

A packed social week in Nice: visits, a wedding, opera, comedy. Marie transforms her cousin Machenka's outfit in ten minutes flat—opening the bodice, adding a Chantilly lace fichu, a brooch, a medallion, a flower to match the mauve dress. For Paul, missing a shirt button, she improvises a boutonnière from a morning glory flower and a green leaf. "Très original."

But the day ends with her body betraying her. At dinner, her father casually mentions the Duke of Hamilton, and Marie turns crimson. Worse, her mother notices. That watchful maternal gaze only makes the blushing worse.

A year after first seeing him, Hamilton still has this effect on her. And she knows it. That final line—"Non, je n'ai pas cessé de rougir!"—is pure Marie: defiant, self-aware, and unwilling to pretend otherwise.

**February 4, 1874** — Nice

Marie is 15, and the Duke of Hamilton still makes her blush.

> "Papa said something about Hamilton, I blushed as I haven't in a long time and I felt mama's eyes turn to my face, which increased and prolonged the redness. No, I haven't stopped blushing!"

It's been a year since she first saw him. She's tried to move on. She's transformed her cousin's outfit in ten minutes, received fabric samples from the House of Worth, attended to a wedding, opera, and comedy in the same week.

But when her father mentions Hamilton's name at dinner, her face betrays her. And her mother is watching.

Marie's radical honesty extends even to her own involuntary reactions. She can't hide from herself.

Marie is 15. Her father mentions the Duke of Hamilton at dinner, and her face turns crimson. Worse—her mother notices.

# TikTok Script

**[HOOK - Text on screen]**
A 15-year-old girl wrote this in her diary 150 years ago today:

**[DRAMATIC READING - voiceover]**
"Papa said something about Hamilton..."

"I blushed as I haven't in a long time..."

"And I felt mama's eyes turn to my face..."

"Which increased and prolonged the redness."

"No, I haven't stopped blushing!"

**[CONTEXT - speaking to camera or text overlay]**
Marie Bashkirtseff. 1874. Nice, France.

She'd seen the Duke of Hamilton a year before and couldn't forget him.

At dinner, her father mentions his name. She turns crimson. Her mother notices.

She writes it all down—even the parts that embarrass her.

Her diary was censored for over a century. Now we can finally read what she really wrote.

notes_for_scheduler: |
  - Best quote for emphasis: "Non, je n'ai pas cessé de rougir!"
  - Visual suggestion: Period painting of blushing woman, or soft-focus Nice Riviera
  - TikTok could use dramatic reading with period music underneath
  - This entry shows Marie's self-awareness AND the Hamilton obsession - good hook
