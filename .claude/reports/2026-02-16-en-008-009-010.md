## OPS Fixes Detail

### Carnet 008 (3 fixes)
1. **1873-08-21** (sev A): "I revolt" → "I rebel" — false friend from French "je me révolte"
2. **1873-08-19** (sev A): "on the eve of six o'clock" → "on the verge of six o'clock" — gallicism from "à la veille de"
3. **1873-08-24** (sev B): "I thought he had changed his back" → "I thought his back had changed" — more natural phrasing
4. **1873-08-17** (sev C note): "made merry" adequate for "fait la noce" but alternatives noted

### Carnet 009 (2 fixes)
1. **1873-09-08** (sev A): Removed incorrect ==highlight== from "it takes my breath away" — French idiom, not English code-switch
2. **1873-09-10** (sev A): "pretty little muzzle" → "naughty little muzzle" — semantic inversion of "vilain museau"

### Carnet 010 (2 fixes)
1. **1873-09-23** (sev A): Removed incorrect English code-switch highlight from "that's all I'm saying!" — Marie's colloquial French, not English
2. **1873-09-25** (sev A): Split shared footnote [^1] into separate [^1] and [^2] for two distinct English code-switches

## Error Pattern Analysis

### By category:
- **False friends / semantic errors**: 3 (revolt, eve, vilain)
- **Code-switch misidentification**: 2 (French idioms wrongly highlighted as English)
- **Phrasing / naturalness**: 1 (changed his back)
- **Footnote mechanics**: 1 (shared footnote for distinct passages)

### Key finding: No file corruption
Unlike the GEM reviewer (previous run, carnets 006-007), OPS made **zero** inline comment placement errors. All edits were clean, targeted fixes. No structural corruption of any kind.

## OPS vs GEM Comparison

| Metric | GEM (006-007) | OPS (008-010) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Entries reviewed | 56 | 65 |
| Fixes made | ~15-20 | 7 |
| File corruption | ~50% of edits had placement issues | **0%** |
| Post-review git audit needed | Yes (mandatory) | **No** |
| Quality of catches | Mixed (some good, some spurious) | All legitimate |
| False positives | Several | 0 |
| Review passes | 2 (text-only + with-comments) | 2 (naturalness + semantic) |

### Verdict: OPS is the preferred reviewer

OPS advantages:
1. **Zero corruption risk** — no structural damage to files
2. **Higher precision** — every fix was a genuine improvement, no false positives
3. **Consistent quality** — all 3 reviewers (independent agents) performed identically well
4. **No post-review audit needed** — saves significant human/agent time
5. **Better error categorization** — false friends, code-switch misidentification, phrasing

OPS limitation:
- Slightly fewer total catches than GEM, but GEM's extras included false positives and corrupted edits that cost more to fix than they saved

## Translation Quality Notes

All three translators produced HIGH quality work:
- Marie's voice (14-year-old: dramatic, witty, self-contradictory) consistently preserved
- Code-switching (English/Italian/Russian passages) handled correctly per TranslationMemory
- Period vocabulary accurate: bodice, riding habit, consumption, cab, soirée
- Structural markers ([Crossed out:], [In the margin:]) correctly applied
- Long emotional passages (Oct 13 Hamilton engagement, 60 paragraphs) rendered with power
- TranslationMemory terms used consistently across all 3 carnets

## Content Highlights

- **Carnet 008**: Vienna → Paris → Nice journey; Worth shopping; Gioia's portrait at Klein's
- **Carnet 009**: Hamilton obsession peaks; religious/philosophical debates; "while being his wife, I want to be his mistress"
- **Carnet 010**: First shooting + feminist manifesto; Hamilton engagement devastation; Oct 14 empty entry (too overwhelmed)

## Workflow Observations

1. **3 parallel translators** scaled perfectly — no conflicts, no coordination issues
2. **Fresh OPS agent per carnet** (spawned as translation completed) worked well — no context bleed between carnets
3. **Sequential spawn** (translator finishes → OPS starts) minimized idle time
4. **Total wall-clock time**: ~25 minutes for 65 entries (translation + review)

## Recommendation

- **Adopt OPS as standard reviewer**, replacing GEM
- GEM can still be used for spot-checks or second opinions if desired
- No structural changes needed to the workflow — OPS is a drop-in replacement
- Consider increasing to 4-5 parallel translators for larger batches

## Files Modified

- 65 entry files created in content/en/008/, 009/, 010/
- 3 README.md files created (one per carnet)
- 7 entry files edited by OPS reviewers
- All entries marked: translation_complete: true, opus_reviewed: true

## Teamcouch Review

**Reviewed**: 2026-02-16
**Reports analyzed**: 2 substantive (en-000-007, en-008-009-010)

### Patterns Identified

| Pattern | Occurrences | Reports | Action |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| GEM corruption (inline comments, duplicates, stripped markup) | 5+ instances | 1/2 (GEM run only) | Already on WATCHLIST — confirmed |
| OPS zero corruption | 0 instances across 65 entries | 1/2 (OPS run only) | WATCHLIST watch — need 2 more OPS runs to confirm |
| Code-switch misidentification by translators | 2 instances | 1/2 | WATCHLIST watch — new pattern |
| English false friends (revolt, eve, vilain) | 3 instances | 1/2 | WATCHLIST watch — track frequency |
| Agent lifecycle: clean shutdowns, no crashes | All agents | 2/2 | Confirmed — per-carnet pattern stable |
| Shutdown acknowledgment delays (2-3 idle cycles) | All shutdowns | 2/2 | Already on WATCHLIST — cosmetic, no action needed |
| Translation quality HIGH across all translators | 131 entries | 2/2 | Baseline established |

### Skill Updates Applied

**None.** Only 2 substantive reports available — below the 3-report threshold for skill changes. All new patterns go to WATCHLIST for monitoring.

### WATCHLIST Changes

**Added:**
- Code-switch misidentification by EN translators (French idioms wrongly highlighted as English code-switches — "it takes my breath away", "that's all I'm saying!")
- OPS zero-corruption track record (1 run, 65 entries, 0 corruption — watch for confirmation across 2+ more runs)
- English false friends: "revolt" (≠ se révolter), "eve" (≠ à la veille de), "vilain" (≠ naughty not pretty)

**No changes to existing items.** GEM corruption patterns remain active (only 1 GEM run in this analysis window).

### Recommendations for Human

1. **Run OPS for 2 more carnets before formally deprecating GEM.** The data strongly favors OPS (zero corruption, zero false positives, all legitimate catches), but we have only 1 OPS run. Two more will meet the 3-report threshold for a pipeline change.

2. **Consider adding English-specific false friends to translator skill** after 3+ reports. Current candidates: revolt/révolter, eve/veille, vilain/naughty. The translator skill's false friends section currently uses Czech examples only — English examples would help EN translators.

3. **Consider adding code-switch guidance to translator skill.** Two translators independently highlighted French idioms that happened to produce natural English ("it takes my breath away", "that's all I'm saying!"). A brief note in the translator skill about distinguishing translated idioms from actual code-switches could prevent this.

4. **Clean up empty draft reports.** Reports 2026-02-16-en-000-006-007-{2,3,4,5,6,7}.md are all empty templates from session-end hooks. They clutter the reports directory and provide no analytical value.

5. **Wall-clock efficiency is excellent.** 65 entries in ~25 minutes (TR + OPS) with 3 parallel translators. The per-carnet agent pattern and sequential OPS spawn are working well. No workflow changes needed.
