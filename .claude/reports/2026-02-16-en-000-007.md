# Team Run Report: EN 000, 006-007

## Configuration

- **Skills used**: translator (three-phase, v2), gemini-editor (two-pass, v1)
- **Models**: Opus (translator subagent type), general-purpose (GEM subagent type)
- **Team structure**: 2 translators in parallel (006, 007) + 3 GEM reviewers sequentially (000, then 006+007 in parallel)
- **Team name**: en-translation

## Results

| Carnet | Entries | Agent | Phase | Fixes | Issues |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 000 | 10 | gem-reviewer | GEM only | 15 sev B (pass 1), 4 sev B (pass 2) | 2 audit fixes |
| 006 | 27 | translator-006 | TR + GEM | 18 files (pass 1), 5 files (pass 2) | 3 audit fixes |
| 007 | 29 | translator-007 | TR + GEM | 29 files (pass 1), 3 semantic (pass 2) | 2 audit fixes |

**Total**: 66 entries translated, 66 entries GEM-reviewed

## Agent Lifecycle

### Translators
- **translator-006**: completed all 27 entries, clean shutdown on request. No issues.
- **translator-007**: completed all 29 entries, clean shutdown on request. Finished slightly before translator-006.

### GEM Reviewers
- **gem-reviewer** (carnet 000): completed both passes, clean shutdown. First to finish.
- **gem-reviewer-006**: went idle with reason "interrupted" mid-run. Recovered after team lead ping. Completed both passes. Mentioned Gemini quota exhaustion but no entries were skipped. Clean shutdown.
- **gem-reviewer-007**: completed both passes normally. Clean shutdown.

### Lifecycle Observations
- All agents stopped properly after their carnet (one-carnet-per-agent pattern working)
- No agents checked TaskList for more work
- Shutdown acknowledgment took 2-3 idle cycles for some agents (not harmful, just noisy)
- gem-reviewer-006 "interrupted" state needs investigation — possibly Gemini API timeout

## Issues Encountered

### GEM Corruption (recurring)

Same patterns as always:
- **Inline GEM comments** splitting paragraph text: 000 (1 file), 006 (1 file), 007 (1 file)
- **Duplicate paragraph** insertion: 006 (1 file, paragraph 006.0030)
- **Removed code-switch markup**: 006 (1 file, ==affatto== removed)
- **Gemini translating French** in comments: 000 (1 file, "meme" -> "even")
- **Displaced footnote**: 007 (1 file)

All manually caught and fixed during audit phase. The pattern is consistent — roughly 1-3 corruption issues per carnet per GEM pass.

### Gemini Rate Limits

- gem-reviewer-006 reported quota exhaustion. No entries were actually skipped this run.
- Worth monitoring — if we scale to more parallel GEM reviewers, rate limits will become a real constraint.

### Agent Communication

- gem-reviewer-006 sent a redundant message about stopping GEM reviews due to quota — this was after work was already complete. Minor noise.

## Observations

- **Translation quality was high** — GEM found only severity B issues across all three carnets. No severity A (must-fix) issues at all.
- **English code-switching well-handled** — Marie writes extensive English passages in this period. Both translators correctly marked them with ==highlight== and footnotes.
- **Notable semantic catches by GEM**: "wagon" = railway carriage not carriage (007), "machinistes" = engine drivers not stagehands (007), "sympathie" = liking not sympathy (006)
- **The parallel translator + sequential GEM pattern worked well** — translators run simultaneously, GEM reviewers dispatched as translations complete.
- **No RED or CON review** — this was a lighter pipeline (TR + GEM only). Consider adding RED for future English runs.

## Quality Notes

- Carnet 000 (preface): GEM found 19 fixes, all sev B. Quality was already high from previous translation.
- Carnet 006: 23+ GEM fixes. Several false friend catches ("sympathie", "effroi", "commode").
- Carnet 007: 29 files touched in pass 1 (naturalness), 3 semantic fixes in pass 2. Good quality.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Post-processing script for GEM inline comments** — instead of manual audit, run a script after each GEM pass that detects and fixes inline `%% GEM: %%` placement. Would eliminate the most common audit issue.
2. **Add RED review to English pipeline** — current Czech pipeline uses TR + GEM + RED + CON. English skipped RED/CON this run. Should add at least RED for consistency.
3. **Investigate "interrupted" idle state** — gem-reviewer-006's interrupted state may be a Gemini API timeout. If confirmed, add timeout handling to GEM skill.
