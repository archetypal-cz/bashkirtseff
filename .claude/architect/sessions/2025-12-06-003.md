# Architect Session: 2025-12-06-003

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Focus**: Second pipeline test and verification

---

## Summary

Successfully ran second full pipeline test on entry 1882-05-03 (Book 15), verifying all components work correctly including hooks.

## What Was Done

### 1. Pipeline Test: 1882-05-03

Entry content: Julian criticizes Marie's Nice paintings, she internalizes gendered critique "travail de femme", then shifts to theatrical self-awareness.

| Phase | Cost | Time | Score |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| Research | $0.90 | ~2min | 0.95 |
| Annotation | $0.58 | ~2min | 0.87 |
| Translation | $0.39 | ~2min | 0.88 |
| Editor | $0.29 | ~1min | 0.82 |
| Conductor | $0.19 | ~1min | 0.89 |
| **Total** | **$2.35** | **~8min** | **APPROVED** |

### 2. Hook Verification

All three hooks triggered correctly:
- `SubagentStop` → logged 5 agents to decision_log.md
- `Stop` → logged 5 sessions to session_log.md
- `PostToolUse(Write)` → ran without errors

### 3. Commits Created

1. Multi-agent workflow infrastructure (32 files)
2. Workflow state files (13 files)
3. Glossary updates (6 files)
4. Annotated originals (2 files)
5. Czech translations (2 files)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Accept $0.90 research cost | Quality justifies cost; extensive glossary work |
| Separate commits by type | Clean history, easier to review/revert |

## Pipeline Comparison

| Entry | Total Cost | Time | Quality | Verdict |
|-------|------------|------|---------|---------|
| 1882-05-01 | $2.90 | ~8min | 0.925 | APPROVED |
| 1882-05-03 | $2.35 | ~8min | 0.89 | APPROVED |

Cost reduction in second run likely due to cache hits and simpler entity set.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/cz/15/1882-05-03.md` (translation)
- `src/_original/_glossary/Jules_Lefebvre.md` (new glossary)
- 5 workflow JSON files for 1882-05-03

### Modified Files
- `src/_original/15/1882-05-03.md` (annotations)
- `src/_original/_workflow/decision_log.md` (hook entries)
- `src/_original/_workflow/session_log.md` (hook entries)

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing with more entries
2. Consider batch processing workflow
3. Test revision loop (when editor says needs_revision)
4. Implement ED orchestration mode

## Open Questions

- Should we test an entry that triggers revision loop?
- Ready for batch processing of Book 15?

## Session Notes

Second successful pipeline run confirms system stability. Hooks are working as designed. Cost variance between entries (~$0.55) is acceptable and driven by research complexity.
