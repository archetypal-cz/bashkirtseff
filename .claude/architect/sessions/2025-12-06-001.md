# Architect Session: 2025-12-06-001

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Initial system design and implementation

---

## Summary

Designed and implemented the complete multi-agent translation workflow system from scratch.

## What Was Done

### 1. Architecture Design
- Established layered hierarchy: Human → ED → Conductor → Workers
- Defined 6 translation roles + 1 meta role (Workflow Architect)
- Created decision framework for quality scoring and revision loops

### 2. New Role: Linguistic Annotator
- Identified need for separate linguistic expertise
- Creates translation guidance notes in ORIGINAL files
- Benefits all target languages (not just Czech)
- Uses Opus for subtle linguistic judgment

### 3. Files Created
- `MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md` - Complete design document
- `.claude/project_config.md` - Global configuration
- `.claude/skills/` - 7 skill files (6 roles + architect)
- `.claude/agents/` - 5 subagent definitions
- `.claude/commands/architect.md` - Slash command
- `.claude/architect/` - This workspace
- `src/_original/_workflow/` - Workflow state directory
- Updated `justfile` with workflow commands

### 4. Design Decisions
- ADR-001: Three-level hierarchy
- ADR-002: Linguistic Annotator as separate role
- ADR-003: File-based state management
- ADR-004: Justfile as orchestration interface

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Separate Researcher/LAN | Different expertise, different model needs |
| File-based state | Simple, visible, version-controlled |
| Justfile integration | Already in use, supports both headless and interactive |
| Opus for LAN + Conductor | Subtle judgment requires stronger model |
| Configurable analysis frequency | Start tight (every 3 entries), relax as system matures |

## Issues Discovered

- ISSUE-001: Pipeline not yet tested
- ISSUE-002: JSON output format unvalidated
- ISSUE-003: No hooks configured

## Ideas Generated

- IDEA-001: Hooks for automatic logging
- IDEA-002: Parallel subagent execution
- IDEA-003: Quality trend visualization
- IDEA-004: Cross-entry consistency checker
- IDEA-005: Slash commands for common operations
- IDEA-006: TranslationMemory integration

## Next Steps

1. **Priority**: Test pipeline on `1882-05-01` entry
2. Validate JSON output format from headless mode
3. Configure hooks for automatic logging
4. Test ED orchestration with subagents

## Open Questions

- How should revision loops work in practice?
- What's the right analysis_frequency for this project?
- Should we add more slash commands?

## Session Notes

User wanted a "meta" role for developing the system itself, not just translation roles. Created Workflow Architect with comprehensive documentation embedded in the skill file for session continuity.

Key insight: The architect needs their own workspace separate from translation workflow state.
