# March 1873 - Monthly Summary

## Overview
The March 1873 entries (1st-12th) conclude Marie Bashkirtseff's second notebook (Carnet N° 2). This period marks a significant transition in Marie's life as she learns that the Duke of Hamilton has departed Nice, forcing her to reconsider her romantic aspirations. The month also features a pivotal moment when Marie discovers her singing talent might provide a path to fame and the Duke's attention.

## Key Themes

### The Departure of the Duke
Early in March, Marie learns that the Duke of Hamilton's yacht has left Nice eight days earlier, meaning he has departed without her ever having been properly introduced to him. This news devastates her:
— She expresses rage and despair at being "ignored" by him
— Laments having no purpose for her promenades and social appearances
— Imagines him in Paris, planning to somehow see him there
— Compares her feelings to those for someone who has died

### Singing as a Path to Glory
A transformative moment occurs on March 9 when Marie sings for the Howard children and receives enthusiastic praise. This experience leads to an epiphany:
— She realizes her voice could make her a celebrated singer (cantatrice)
— Envisions a career that would bring her fame, admiration, and social power
— Believes this path could ultimately win the Duke's attention and love
— Sees this as divinely inspired - God showing her how to achieve her desires
— Reconciles her aristocratic status with a performing career by emphasizing her noble birth

### Continued Ambivalence Toward Boreel
Marie's feelings about Boreel remain complicated:
— She criticizes him for imitating the Duke's lifestyle without having the means
— Expresses disappointment at his visits to Monaco and rumors of his behavior there
— Admits to missing seeing him on the promenade
— Notes with satisfaction when he looks at her admiringly
