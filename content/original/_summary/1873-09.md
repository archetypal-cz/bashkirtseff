The September entries continue themes established in August, particularly Marie's return to Nice and her ongoing infatuation with the Duke of Hamilton. Her resumption of studies fulfills the plans mentioned at the end of August. The family's teasing about the Duke, which began upon her return to Nice in late August, continues throughout early September.
