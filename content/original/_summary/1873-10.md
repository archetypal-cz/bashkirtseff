## Psychological Observations

October 1873 shows Marie in an increasingly fragile psychological state. Her obsession with Hamilton has moved beyond romantic fantasy into something more concerning - she exhibits signs of:
— Obsessive-compulsive behaviors (positioning herself to see him)
— Delusional thinking (interpreting random events as signs)
— Physical symptoms of anxiety and depression
— Social withdrawal except for Hamilton-related activities

## Connections to Previous and Future Events

The October entries show the progression from the relatively lighthearted infatuation of earlier months to a more serious psychological crisis. The mentions of Hamilton's marriage preparations foreshadow the devastating news that will come in December. Marie's social isolation, which began with the Tutcheff conflict, deepens significantly this month, setting up her increasingly desperate state in November and December.
