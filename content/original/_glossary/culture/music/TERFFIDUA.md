Marie is less impressed by Terffidua's attention than her companions, showing her more discerning (or perhaps more ambitious) romantic standards.

## Connection to Marie's World
Terffidua represents the type of ordinary romantic attention that Marie receives but doesn't particularly value, contrasting with her obsessions with aristocratic figures like Johnstone and the Prince of Wales.
