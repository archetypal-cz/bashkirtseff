Louise Michel (1830-1905), French anarchist, teacher, and major figure in the Paris Commune of 1871. Known as "La Vierge Rouge" (The Red Virgin), she was one of the most prominent radical activists of her era.

## Historical Context
After the fall of the Commune, Michel was deported to New Caledonia (1873-1880). Upon her return to France in late 1880, she resumed militant political activity. She was a powerful orator and writer advocating for workers' rights, women's rights, and revolutionary change.

## Diary References
- February 14, 1881: Marie sends Julian a red tulip as a joke referencing Louise Michel, suggesting they had previously laughed together about her
- February 16, 1881: Marie notes how newspapers always link Hubertine Auclert with Louise Michel, though Marie sees them as very different (Hubertine is "extrêmement modérée")

## Marie's Perspective
Marie seems to view Louise Michel with some ambivalence - joking about her with Julian while also recognizing the unfair media clichés that lump all feminist activists together. Marie distinguishes between Auclert's moderate feminism and Michel's radical anarchism.
