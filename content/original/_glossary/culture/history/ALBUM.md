*L'Album* was a Bonapartist newspaper in Paris during the Third Republic. It was one of the journals where Paul de Cassagnac published his political writings.

In her entry of October 20, 1880, Marie refers to an article by Cassagnac in *L'Album* regarding the Bonapartist political crisis at the Cirque Fernando. She notes: "Read Cassagnac's article in l'Album, October 20, 1880, with the note in my handwriting, [missing]"

This indicates Marie was keeping Cassagnac's articles, annotating them with her own comments - evidence of her continued interest in him despite her growing disillusionment with his politics. She finds his political maneuvering "inept and ridiculous," particularly his hypocritical stance of denying involvement in the Cirque Fernando meeting while celebrating it in his newspaper.

The newspaper appears to have been part of the constellation of Bonapartist press organs that kept the Imperial cause alive during the early Third Republic, despite the movement's declining political relevance.
