## Overview

Epictetus (Greek: Ἐπίκτητος; c. 50 - c. 135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. Born a slave in Phrygia (modern-day Turkey), he eventually gained his freedom and established his own school of philosophy in Nicopolis, Greece.

## Stoic Philosophy

Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life, not just theoretical discourse. His core teachings include:

### The Dichotomy of Control
- Some things are within our control (our judgments, impulses, desires, aversions)
- Most things are not within our control (our body, property, reputation, social position)
- Wisdom lies in focusing only on what we can control
- External events are neither good nor bad - only our reactions to them matter

### Key Principles
- **Virtue is the only good**: External circumstances cannot harm us
- **Indifference (*apatheia*)**: Freedom from passion and emotional disturbance
- **Acceptance**: Amor fati - love of fate, accepting what happens
- **Self-mastery**: Control your reactions, not external events
- **Duty (*kathêkon*)**: Live according to nature and reason

## His Teachings

Epictetus didn't write himself - his teachings were recorded by his student Arrian in:
- **The Discourses** (*Diatribai*) - longer discussions of philosophical topics
- **The Enchiridion** (Handbook) - short, practical manual of Stoic ethics

Famous sayings:
- "It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters"
- "We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond"
- "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has"

## Marie's Reference (October 5, 1880)

In a moment of deep despair about her health, family tensions, and social failures, Marie turns to Stoic philosophy:

> "Vaincre ses sensations et se dire avec Épictète qu'on est maître de prendre le mal pour le bien, ou plutôt de rester indifférent à ce qui arrive."
>
> ("Overcome one's sensations and tell oneself with Epictetus that one is master of taking bad for good, or rather of remaining indifferent to what happens.")

## Context in Marie's Diary

This entry shows Marie at age 22:
- Suffering from fever, laryngitis, and chronic illness
- Frustrated by family's overprotective behavior
- Haunted by social humiliations in Nice and Rome
- Prophesying her own death ("I will die, but not right away")
- Turning to Stoic indifference as a form of emotional survival

She writes: "It is only after having suffered horribly that one accepts leaving life by this kind of death, and it is only after unheard-of sufferings and complete despair that one begins to understand the possibility of this dead life."

This is not casual philosophical interest - Marie is contemplating Stoic *apatheia* (indifference) as a way to endure unbearable suffering. She's considering emotional detachment as a form of living death that would at least bring tranquility.

## Significance

Marie's engagement with Epictetus reveals:
- **Serious philosophical education**: She's not just name-dropping but engaging with core Stoic concepts
- **Psychological sophistication**: Understanding that changing perceptions can change experience
- **Desperation**: Turning to radical philosophy of indifference shows depth of suffering
- **Intellectual resources**: Using philosophy as coping mechanism for physical and social pain

The reference also shows the influence of Classical philosophy in 19th century French elite education. Educated Russians like Marie would have studied ancient philosophy as part of their cultural formation.
