## Historical Context

Cagnes-sur-Mer (often referred to simply as Cagnes) is a town near Nice that hosted horse races, a popular entertainment among the aristocratic winter visitors to the French Riviera. Horse racing was an important part of the social season, and many aristocrats owned racehorses or followed the races closely.

The name "Astrolabe" (a navigational instrument) suggests a sophisticated owner with maritime or scientific interests. In the 19th century, naming racehorses after nautical instruments was common among aristocrats with naval connections.

Marie's excited mention suggests either:
- She had placed bets on the horse (or her family had)
- The horse belonged to someone in her social circle
- She was following the races as part of the social activities of Nice
