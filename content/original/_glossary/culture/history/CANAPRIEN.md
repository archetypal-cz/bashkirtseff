A person the Bashkirtseff family encountered during the Nice Carnival festivities.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 23, 1873**: During the carnival parade, the Bashkirtseff family saw Canaprien on the Pont Neuf (New Bridge). Marie's mother threw flowers to them.

## Historical Context

The Pont Neuf was a vantage point for watching the carnival procession. The flower-throwing was a central part of Nice Carnival festivities - participants in carriages would throw bouquets to friends and acquaintances as a form of greeting and celebration.

That Marie's mother took the initiative to throw flowers to Canaprien suggests:
- This was a social acquaintance the family wished to acknowledge
- The gesture was a friendly recognition during the festive atmosphere
- Canaprien was positioned where they could be seen from the Bashkirtseff carriage

The name "Canaprien" is unusual and difficult to place ethnically, which was common in Nice's international colony where names from across Europe mingled.
