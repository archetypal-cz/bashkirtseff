## Definition and Origin

"Plobster" is Marie Bashkirtseff's invented code word for men who attract her attention, either through genuine appeal or ridiculous behavior. The term appears to be her creation, possibly a playful combination of words or a private joke within her circle.

## Evolution of Usage

### Initial Usage (1874)
The term first appears in Marie's diary during her time in Spa and Ostende in summer 1874. Initially, it seems to refer to attractive, aristocratic men whom Marie admires:
- "Ce que je regrette le plus ce sont les Plobsters d'ici qui sont admirables" (What I regret most are the Plobsters here who are admirable) - August 11, 1874, leaving Spa
- She speaks of the quality and quantity of Plobsters at Spa

### Expanded Meaning
By late August 1874, the term evolves to include men who are objects of mockery:
- The Comte de Mulinare/Moelenar becomes "Plobster" due to his excessive posing and ridiculous behavior
- Marie notes he's "not a real Plobster" when his conversation reveals lack of polish
- She refers to "le vrai et le premier de la dynastie des Plobster" (the true and first of the Plobster dynasty)

## Social Function

The term serves multiple purposes in Marie's social world:
1. **Private Language**: Creates insider communication within her circle
2. **Social Commentary**: Allows her to categorize and judge men
3. **Entertainment**: Provides amusement through observation and mockery
4. **Protection**: Offers emotional distance through humor

## Examples of Plobsters

- **Admired Plobsters**: The high-quality aristocrats at Spa
- **Ridiculous Plobsters**: Comte de Mulinare with his lobster-like appearance and excessive posing
- **Potential Plobsters**: Men seeking introduction who don't meet standards

## Cultural Context

Marie's invention of this term reflects:
- The leisure culture of 19th-century European spas and resorts
- Young women's need for coded language to discuss men
- The sport of people-watching as entertainment
- Her sharp wit and tendency toward social satire

## Linguistic Note

The word may derive from:
- A corruption or play on "lobster" (homard in French), especially given her comparison of Moelenar to a lobster
- A private joke or nonsense word
- A combination of other terms known only to Marie's circle

The term demonstrates Marie's linguistic creativity and her delight in creating private vocabularies for her observations of society.
