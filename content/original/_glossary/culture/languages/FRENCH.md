## Overview

French is Marie Bashkirtseff's primary language of writing. All diary entries are predominantly in French. As the default language, paragraphs written entirely in French do not require explicit language tagging.

## Usage Notes

- Default language - no tag needed when paragraph is French-only
- When Marie mixes French with other languages, the paragraph should be tagged with both #French and the other language(s)
- French is implicit; tagging is only necessary when other languages are present
