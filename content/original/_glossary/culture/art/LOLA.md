# Lola

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Book 00 (1884 retrospective)

## Basic Information

Lola was the daughter of Georges Babanine and his wife Domenica. She was Marie Bashkirtseff's cousin and the sister of Dina and Etienne.

## Family Position

Lola was the second daughter of Georges and Domenica:
1. **Dina** - Older sister, taken and raised by grand-maman, became Countess Toulouse-Lautrec
2. **Lola** - Middle child
3. **Etienne** - Younger brother, died at age sixteen

## What Marie Records (1884)

In her retrospective preface, Marie provides minimal information:
- **"La fille est mariée"** - "The daughter is married" (as of 1884)

This terse mention suggests:
- **Distant Relationship**: Marie didn't know Lola well or didn't consider her significant
- **Conventional Life**: Unlike Dina (raised with Marie) or Etienne (dramatic early death), Lola followed a normal path
- **Outside the Household**: Lola apparently was raised by Domenica, unlike Dina who was taken by grand-maman
- **Unremarkable**: No scandals, dramas, or noteworthy events to record

## Contrast with Her Siblings

The stark difference in Marie's treatment of the three siblings is revealing:

### Dina
- Extensive diary mentions
- Raised in the household with Marie
- Lifelong companion
- Became Countess Toulouse-Lautrec
- Marie painted her portrait

### Etienne
- Marie promises to explain his death at sixteen
- Implies a dramatic or tragic story worth telling
- Enough significance to warrant future narrative

### Lola
- Single sentence: "La fille est mariée"
- No further elaboration
- No indication of relationship or contact
- Essentially forgotten in Marie's narrative

## Possible Explanations

Several factors might explain Lola's minimal presence:

1. **Age Difference**: Lola may have been significantly older or younger than Marie, limiting childhood interaction
2. **Separate Upbringing**: Raised by Domenica rather than in the main Babanine household
3. **Early Marriage**: May have married young and left the family orbit before Marie knew her well
4. **Geographic Distance**: Could have been living elsewhere by the 1870s-1880s
5. **Personality**: Simply may not have been memorable or significant to Marie
6. **Social Class**: If married beneath her station, might have been minimized in family narrative

## Historical Context

### Marriage as Woman's Destiny (1870s-1880s)

For women of Lola's generation and class, marriage was the expected life path. Marie's single-sentence summary "La fille est mariée" treats this as:
- **Expected Outcome**: Nothing remarkable about a woman marrying
- **Complete Story**: Once married, a woman's independent identity was subsumed
- **Successful Fate**: Better than remaining unmarried, at least from family perspective

### Contrast with Marie's Path

By 1884 when Marie writes this, she herself has:
- Rejected multiple marriage proposals
- Pursued art career professionally
- Achieved Salon recognition
- Chosen independence over conventional marriage

Her dismissive one-line treatment of Lola's marriage may reflect:
- **Disdain for Conventional Path**: Marriage as boring, unremarkable fate
- **Artistic Superiority**: Marie chose a more interesting life
- **Limited Imagination**: Unable to see Lola's life as having intrinsic interest

## Unknown Details

Marie's preface leaves many questions unanswered:
- When did Lola marry?
- Whom did she marry?
- Where did she live?
- Did she have children?
- What was her relationship with Marie?
- Is she still alive in 1884?
- What became of her after Marie's death in 1884?
