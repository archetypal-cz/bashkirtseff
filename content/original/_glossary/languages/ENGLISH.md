# English

Marie Bashkirtseff frequently code-switches to English in her diary, using it for:

- **Emotional intensity**: English words for feelings and dramatic moments
- **Sophistication markers**: Fashion terms, social terminology
- **Privacy/discretion**: Sensitive matters she wanted less accessible
- **Cultural affinity**: Demonstrating cosmopolitan education

## Common English Words in Marie's Diary

- "heart-broken", "bewilderment"
- "fashionable", "waterproof"
- "nonsenses", "flirtation"
- "shocking", "dreadful"

## Usage Notes for Translators

When Marie uses English, she is making a deliberate linguistic choice. Consider:
- Preserving the code-switch in translation (keeping English words)
- Adding translator notes explaining the significance
- The emotional register English carries for Marie
