# U... Family

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1873-02-12

A family in Nice society that experienced a tragedy on February 10, 1873, when the mother died suddenly. Marie refers to "le jeune U..." who was told his mother was very ill during lunch, but she had already died before he arrived.

## The Tragedy

Marie writes: "Au déjeuner on annonce au jeune U... que sa mère est très mal. Avant d'arriver, elle était morte. C'est affreux pour cet enfant."

This death caused Marie to miss the Tir aux Pigeons (pigeon shooting) that day, presumably due to the social obligations surrounding the death of someone in their social circle.

## Marie's Response

Marie's reaction is revealing - while she acknowledges the tragedy as "affreux pour cet enfant," she focuses more on missing the opportunity to see the Duke at the pigeon shooting. She cried "comme une bête" throughout the day, but admits: "c'est surtout l'occasion manquée de voir le duc qui m'ennuie."
