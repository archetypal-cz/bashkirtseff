A location near Nice where the Bashkirtseff family and the Howard family held a picnic on April 26, 1873.

## The Picnic (April 26, 1873)
Despite rainy weather, three carriages set out for Mont Vinaigre:
- First carriage: Adults (Marie's aunt, Mr. & Mrs. Howard, Mr. Copeland)
- Second carriage: Girls (Hélène, Lise, Aggie Howard, and Marie)
- Third carriage: Mlle Collignon, Mlle Gaspard, and the Howard boys

When rain intensified, they found an empty villa and were allowed to use the conservatory/winter garden for their picnic. After eating, they took a short walk before returning to Nice around 3 PM.

## Marie's Observations
Marie notes she bonded with Hélène Howard, who shares her preferences for society over nature: "elle dit qu'elle n'aime pas les fleurs, les belles vues" (she says she doesn't like flowers or beautiful views). Marie writes approvingly: "elle aime le monde, elle a raison!" (she loves society, she's right!)
