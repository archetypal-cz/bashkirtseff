## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 24, 1873**: Marie notes that the Marquis de Bellevue was presented to her mother (Maman) at the ball at the Cercle Masséna. This is mentioned in contrast to Boreel, who approached Marie's mother without a formal introduction.

## Historical Context

The title "Marquis" was a high rank in the French nobility, below only Duke and Prince. The formal presentation to Marie's mother indicates proper social protocol - at balls and social events, gentlemen could not simply approach ladies without being properly introduced by a mutual acquaintance or host.

The mention of this presentation suggests that:
- The Marquis de Bellevue was seeking to establish or maintain social connections with the Bashkirtseff family
- Marie's mother was considered an appropriate person for a marquis to meet
- The social hierarchies and protocols of Nice society were strictly observed

The contrast Marie draws between the Marquis's proper introduction and Boreel's informal approach to her mother highlights the different social styles and perhaps the different motives of these men.
