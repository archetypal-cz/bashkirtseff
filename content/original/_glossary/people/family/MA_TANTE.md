## Overview

"Ma tante" (my aunt) is one of the most important figures in Marie Bashkirtseff's early diary entries. Her name is Sophie, as revealed in the December 1873 entries. She served as Marie's primary guardian during the family's travels through Europe in 1873-1874, particularly during their stays in Vienna, Baden-Baden, Paris, and Nice.

## Role in Marie's Life

Marie's aunt acted as:
- **Primary Guardian**: Responsible for Marie's day-to-day care and decisions during their European travels
- **Financial Manager**: Controlled the family purse strings and made decisions about purchases and travel
- **Chaperone**: Accompanied Marie to social events, shops, and cultural activities
- **Indulgent Caretaker**: Despite occasional conflicts, she was notably devoted to Marie

## Character Traits

Based on Marie's descriptions:
- **Devoted**: "Comme ma tante m'adore!" (How my aunt adores me!) - August 11, 1873
- **Protective**: Quick to defend Marie against Paul's teasing
- **Cautious with Money**: Often cited financial concerns when resisting Marie's wishes
- **Ultimately Yielding**: Despite initial resistance, usually gave in to Marie's persistent requests

## Notable Interactions

### The Paris Campaign (August 1873)
One of the most revealing episodes occurs on August 12, 1873, when Marie desperately wants to go to Paris for shopping. Her aunt initially refuses firmly, citing lack of funds. Marie describes an extended negotiation:
- Initial firm refusal
- Marie's persistent but gentle pleading
- Calculations about costs
- Eventual capitulation with "oui"

This pattern - initial resistance followed by surrender to Marie's wishes - characterizes their relationship throughout the diary.

### Daily Devotion
Marie frequently notes her aunt's devoted attention:
- Waiting for Marie to go to bed before retiring
- Never making decisions without considering Marie
- Immediately coming to Marie's defense when Paul teases her

## Relationship Dynamics

The relationship reveals:
- Marie's awareness of her power over her aunt
- Her aunt's genuine affection despite Marie's manipulation
- The complex dynamics of a guardian trying to be both authority figure and loving relative
- Marie's mixed feelings of gratitude and occasional frustration

## Historical Context

In 19th century European aristocratic families, unmarried or widowed female relatives often served as guardians and chaperones for young women. This aunt fulfilled the crucial role of maintaining propriety while allowing Marie considerable freedom for her age and era.

## Questions for Further Research

- What was the aunt's actual name?
- Was she Marie's maternal or paternal aunt?
- What was her own social and marital status?
- Why was she, rather than Marie's mother, serving as primary guardian during this period?
