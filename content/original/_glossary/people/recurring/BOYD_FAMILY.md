## Overview

The Boyd family was an English aristocratic family that Marie Bashkirtseff encountered in Baden-Baden around 1870. The family represented the kind of fashionable, well-connected international elite that Marie desperately wanted to join as a child.

## Family Members

### Berthe Boyd (Mlle Boyd)

- **Age in 1870**: 12 years old
- **Nationality**: English
- **Social Status**: Connected to aristocratic families in Baden-Baden
- **Characteristics**: Had "several ravishing older sisters" who were leaders of Baden-Baden society ("tenant le haut du pavé à Bade")
- **Social Circle**: Connected to children of aristocratic families through her family's connections
- **Romantic Interest**: Had a 13-year-old "sweetheart" named Rémy de Gonzalès Moreno

### The Boyd Sisters

Marie describes Berthe as having "plusieurs grandes sœurs ravissantes" (several ravishing older sisters) who were social leaders in Baden-Baden. These sisters set the tone for high society in the resort town.

## Social Context in Baden-Baden (c. 1870)

The Boyd family epitomized the exclusive international society that gathered at European spa resorts like Baden-Baden. They were:
- Well-connected to other aristocratic families
- Part of the "chic group" of children that Marie observed
- Leaders of social hierarchy among the resort's visitors
- Representatives of the English aristocracy on the continent

## Marie's Encounter with the Boyds

In her 1884 retrospective (Book 00), Marie recalls a painful childhood memory from Baden-Baden:

> "Near the casino there were groups of children, separate groups. I immediately distinguished the chic group and had only one dream: to be part of it."

Berthe Boyd approached Marie to speak with her, and Marie was so excited that "I said stupid things and the whole group made fun of me outrageously." This humiliating experience became one of Marie's formative memories about social hierarchy and acceptance.

## The Boyds and Class Anxiety

The Boyd family represents a crucial theme in Marie's development: her awareness of social stratification even among children, and her painful exclusion from the "right" group. Key elements:

- **Family Connections Matter**: The Boyd children were accepted because "they knew her [Berthe's] family"
- **Marie's Family Didn't Know Anyone**: Marie's family "knew no one"
- **Class Markers**: While the Boyds socialized, Marie's family "wallowed in roulette and trente-et-quarante" (gambling games)
- **Lasting Impact**: This rejection shaped Marie's lifelong obsession with social acceptance

## Historical Context

### Baden-Baden as International Resort

Baden-Baden in the 1860s-70s was one of Europe's premier spa destinations, attracting:
- European royalty and aristocracy
- Wealthy Russian nobility (including the Bashkirtseffs)
- English aristocratic families (like the Boyds)
- International high society

The town's casino, thermal baths, and social venues created a microcosm of European elite society where social hierarchies were carefully maintained even among children.

### English Families Abroad

English aristocratic families frequently spent time at continental resorts like Baden-Baden, maintaining their social networks while enjoying the spa facilities. The Boyd family's prominence suggests they were well-established in these circuits.

## Later References

Berthe (possibly Berthe Boyd) appears again in Marie's diary in September 1873 as a rival for the Duke of Hamilton's affections, claiming "Hamilton will absolutely marry her." This suggests the Boyd family may have continued to move in the same elite circles as Marie's family.
