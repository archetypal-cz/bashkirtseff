La Cerny was a friend or acquaintance who appears in Marie's Paris social circle in October 1880. She visited Marie's home on multiple occasions, including:
- October 23, when M. de Miranda arrived (Marie notes "and then la Cerny")
- October 24, when she came to dinner with Saint-Amand

The references suggest she was part of Marie's regular social circle during this period. Her name (possibly Czerny or Černý) suggests Central European origins.
