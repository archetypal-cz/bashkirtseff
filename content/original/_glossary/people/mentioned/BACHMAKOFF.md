## Identity

M. Bachmakoff was a Russian official who had served as vice-governor of Poltava, Ukraine, during the time when Marie's mother (Maria Stepanovna Babanina) was a young woman there. The family encountered him in Geneva in 1870 during their flight from Baden-Baden when the Franco-Prussian War was declared.

## Encounter in Geneva (1870)

Marie describes the reunion in Book 00 (paragraph 00.46):

> "Maman rencontra un M. Bachmakoff qui était venu placer le petit Chtcherbine dans un pensionnat célèbre de Genève, celui du docteur Hactius. Le petit garçon était le fils de sa bonne amie qui l'a épousé, sitôt son veuvage. On s'est rencontré à l'église et M. Bachmakoff, avec sa grâce d'homme de cour, fut très aimable, se souvenant de maman jeune fille à Poltava où il avait été vice-gouverneur."

(Maman encountered a M. Bachmakoff who had come to place young Chtcherbine in a famous boarding school in Geneva, that of Dr. Hactius. The little boy was the son of his good friend who married him as soon as she was widowed. They met at church and M. Bachmakoff, with his courtly grace, was very amiable, remembering maman as a young girl in Poltava where he had been vice-governor.)
