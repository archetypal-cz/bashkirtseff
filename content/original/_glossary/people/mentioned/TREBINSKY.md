Someone in Marie's circle whom she refers to as "le sauvage Trebinsky" (the savage Trebinsky) and "apprentis-vétérinaires" (apprentice veterinarians). The hostile tone suggests someone spreading rumors about Marie's health.

The derogatory terms suggest Marie has a very negative view of this person. Context suggests he may have been spreading rumors. Further research needed.
