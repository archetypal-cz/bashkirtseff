## Diary References
- February 16, 1881: At the society meeting, Bal attacks Victor Hugo, claiming that with leisure and money he could have done as well. He votes against participating in Hugo's celebration.

## Marie's Perspective
Marie clearly views Bal with disdain, both for his physical appearance and his presumptuous criticism of Victor Hugo.

## Notes
Represents a more radical or iconoclastic element within the feminist society. Further research needed on identity.
