Rue de la Santé is a street in the 13th and 14th arrondissements of Paris, running north-south near the Observatory district. The street's name derives from a former hospital.

In November 1880, a Capuchin monastery was located on this street. Marie visited it to research her planned painting depicting the expulsion of monks. Only three Capuchin fathers remained there by that time, victims of the Third Republic's anti-clerical policies.

**Notable features:**
- La Santé Prison (built 1867) is located on this street
- The area was on the southern edge of developed Paris in the 1880s
- Mix of religious institutions, hospitals, and working-class housing
