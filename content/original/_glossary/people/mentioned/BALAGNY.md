## Diary References

### 1874
- **February 22**: At Comtesse de Mouzay's, comments on Marie's bust, asking why she "remonte tellement la gorge" (pushes up her chest so much). Marie takes her to another room to prove she's naturally built that way. Balagny is surprised but says it will change with age. Marie calls her "Bête" and jokes she has "un porte-monnaie avec une pièce de cinq kopecks" (a purse with one 5-kopeck coin).

## Context
- Makes tactless personal remarks about young women's bodies
- Marie's sarcastic comment about the kopecks suggests she's poor or stingy
- Represents intrusive older women who comment on girls' development
- Part of the social circle visiting the sick
- Marie's physical response shows her assertiveness when challenged
