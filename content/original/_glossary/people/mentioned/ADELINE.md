Adeline was a friend in Paris who appears in Marie's diary in November 1880. On November 4, Adeline arrives and, "unable to bear it," sends Marie a note asking her to come that evening. Marie spends the evening at Adeline's home.

The phrase "n'y pouvant tenir" (unable to bear it) suggests Adeline was eager to see Marie, perhaps after a separation or with urgent news to share.

Further context needed to identify Adeline's full identity and relationship to Marie.
