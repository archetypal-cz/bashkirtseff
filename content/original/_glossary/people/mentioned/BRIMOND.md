Madame de Brimond was a Parisian friend of Marie and her aunt in 1880. Marie describes her as "a charming woman."

On October 24, 1880, when Marie and her aunt couldn't get a carriage due to rain, Mme de Brimond drove them to "number 37" (likely the address of Dr. Potain or another doctor they were consulting).

Marie notes poignantly: "It's a charming woman and I don't go to her house for fear..." - leaving the sentence unfinished but clearly referring to her increasing deafness, which made her terrified of social visits where she might be unable to hear conversation.

Despite Mme de Brimond's kindness and charm, Marie was avoiding social contact with her precisely because of this disability - revealing how Marie's hearing loss was increasingly isolating her from even her closest friends.
