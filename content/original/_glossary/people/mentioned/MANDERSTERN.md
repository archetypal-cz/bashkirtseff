Manderstern was the marshal of nobility (maréchal de la noblesse) for the province (gouvernement) of Poltava in Russia in 1880. This was an elected position among the nobility, responsible for representing noble interests to the government.

Marie's father held the equivalent position for the district (not the entire province), making Manderstern's position hierarchically superior.

In October 1880, Manderstern and Abaza sent Marie a congratulatory telegram on her father's unanimous election to his position. Marie notes the political importance of this gesture - these were influential figures in Poltava society, and she responds with careful diplomatic courtesy, aware that she may someday need to present her own candidacy in Poltava.

**Russian nobility structure:**
- Marshal of nobility for the province (gouvernement) - Manderstern's position
- Marshal of nobility for the district - Marie's father's position
