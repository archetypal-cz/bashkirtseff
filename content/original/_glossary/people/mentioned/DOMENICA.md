# Domenica (Mme Georges)

**Research Status**: Moderate
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Book 00 (1884 retrospective)

## Basic Information

Domenica was the wife of Georges Babanine (Marie's uncle). She married Georges when she was thirty-six years old and already a widow with a daughter. Georges was only twenty at the time of their marriage. The marriage occurred sometime around 1853-1854, four or five years before Marie's birth in 1858.

## Family Information

### Her Children

From her marriage to Georges, Domenica had three children:
1. **Dina** - Daughter, born before Marie (circa 1853-1854), taken and raised by grand-maman
2. **Lola** - Daughter, later married
3. **Etienne** - Son, died at age sixteen

### Previous Marriage

Domenica was a widow when she married Georges, bringing a daughter from her previous marriage into the Babanine household.

## Character and Reputation

Marie describes her as:
- **"Une femme pratique, très gaie, dit-on"** - "A practical woman, very cheerful, they say"
- **Complex Relationship with Georges**: "Tout en adorant Georges qui l'abandonnait, se donnait quelques distractions" - "While adoring Georges who abandoned her, she allowed herself some distractions"

This suggests:
- **Pragmatic Nature**: She was realistic and practical in handling life
- **Cheerful Disposition**: Known for being gay/cheerful despite difficulties
- **Emotional Complexity**: Loved Georges even though he abandoned her
- **Independence**: Took "distractions" (possibly romantic interests) during his absences
- **Detached Motherhood**: Didn't object strongly when grand-maman took Dina away

## The Dina Situation

When Dina was born, grand-maman took the baby from Domenica "sans cérémonie" (without ceremony) and kept her permanently. Marie notes that Domenica "n'y tenait pas trop" - didn't care too much about this arrangement.

This reveals either:
- **Overwhelmed by Circumstances**: Perhaps unable to care for a newborn adequately
- **Practical Acceptance**: Recognized her mother-in-law could provide better for Dina
- **Emotional Distance**: May not have been deeply maternal
- **Social Judgment**: Grand-maman may have deemed her unfit as a mother

## Historical Context

### Age Gap Marriage (1850s Russia)

The marriage between twenty-year-old Georges and thirty-six-year-old widow Domenica was highly unusual for 1850s Russian nobility:
- **Sixteen-year age gap** with the woman older
- **Widow status** with previous children
- **Secret marriage**: Marie notes M. Babanine's sons "all married without warning him"
- **"More picturesque than edifying"** circumstances

Such marriages in Russian aristocratic society were scandalous and suggest:
- Possible financial motivations
- Social rebellion by Georges
- Romantic passion overriding social conventions
- Family disapproval leading to secrecy

### "Distractions" in 1850s Context

Marie's delicate phrasing about Domenica's "distractions" while Georges "abandoned" her suggests:
- **Extramarital affairs**: Socially transgressive for a wife, even if husband was absent
- **Social Tolerance**: The family seemed to accept this ("dit-on" - "they say" - suggests gossip)
- **Double Standard**: Georges could abandon her, but her "distractions" were noteworthy
- **Practical Arrangement**: Perhaps a tacit understanding in an unconventional marriage

## Family Dynamics

Domenica's position in the Babanine household appears complex:
- **Outsider Status**: Older widow marrying young nobleman, probably not fully accepted
- **Mother-in-law Dominance**: Grand-maman could take her baby without resistance
- **Continued Connection**: Despite losing Dina, remained part of extended family
- **Additional Children**: Had two more children with Georges despite his absences

## Fate Unknown

Marie's 1884 retrospective doesn't mention Domenica's later fate, focusing instead on her children:
- Lola is married (status as of 1884)
- Etienne died at sixteen (Marie promises to explain how)
- Dina became Countess Toulouse-Lautrec
