Race horse competing at Nice races in 1874.

## Diary References

### 1874
- **January 18**: Marie bets on Woerth who falls "comme mort" (like dead) at the last jump along with two other horses. None cleared the final barrier. When lifted, the horse had blood on neck and chest. Marie and others rush to see the injured horse.

## Context
- Steeplechase racing was dangerous for horses and riders
- Falls at jumps common but could be fatal
- Marie's emotional reaction shows sensitivity despite gambling
- Name possibly references Battle of Wörth (1870) in Franco-Prussian War
