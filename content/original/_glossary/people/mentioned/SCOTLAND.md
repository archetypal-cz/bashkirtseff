Scotland is mentioned in the May 1, 1873 entry in a significant context. When discussing summer travel plans at lunch, Mlle Collignon suggests "the mountains of Scotland" while looking at Marie, causing her to blush intensely. 

This appears to be a reference to the Duke of Hamilton, whom Marie loves, as the Dukes of Hamilton are one of Scotland's premier noble families with extensive estates in Scotland. The governess's pointed suggestion seems to be teasing Marie about her romantic interest.

## Connection to Duke of Hamilton
The Hamilton family's Scottish estates would have included:
- Hamilton Palace (demolished 1927)
- Brodick Castle on the Isle of Arran
- Various other properties in Lanarkshire
