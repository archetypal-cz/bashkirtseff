**Diary Coverage**: Book 14 (1880)

Member of Marie's family, likely a relative staying with Marie's mother in Russia or Ukraine. Nadine writes letters to Marie in Paris keeping her informed about family matters.

**References in diary:**
- 1880-11-24: Nadine writes to Marie that her mother ("maman") sobs with each of Marie's letters. This is part of an ongoing family crisis involving some legal or financial "sale affaire" (dirty business) that is keeping Marie's mother away from Paris.

The emotional content of the letter—Marie's mother sobbing over Marie's letters—suggests a difficult family separation. Marie is in Paris pursuing her art studies while her mother is dealing with some unspecified but serious matter elsewhere.

**Context:**
- Family member or close family friend
- Acts as intermediary for news about Marie's mother
- Witness to Marie's mother's emotional state
- Part of the extended Bashkirtseff family circle
