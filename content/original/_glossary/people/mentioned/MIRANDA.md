M. de Miranda was a family friend who appears in Marie's diary in October 1880. He had a grown daughter of twenty years old but appeared quite young himself. Marie describes him as "very amiable."

Miranda visited Marie when the young Juvisy girl came for her guitar lesson (with her mother and sister), along with la Cerny. He also accompanied Marie and her aunt to their appointment with the celebrated Dr. Potain on October 24, 1880.

His presence at the medical appointment suggests he was a close family friend, trusted enough to be included in private health matters.
