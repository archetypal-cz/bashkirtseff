## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 28, 1873**: Marie notes that her mother went to pay a visit to Mme Richaud, part of the social calling rituals that structured aristocratic life in Nice.

## Historical Context

The practice of "paying calls" or "making visits" was a crucial part of 19th-century aristocratic social life. These visits:
- Maintained social connections
- Signaled social standing
- Followed elaborate protocols about timing, duration, and reciprocity
- Were often recorded in social registers

Marie's mother making a visit to Mme Richaud indicates this was a social connection the family wished to maintain or cultivate. The fact that Marie mentions it suggests she was aware of her family's social networking efforts.
