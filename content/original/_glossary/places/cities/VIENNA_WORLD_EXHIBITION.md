# Vienna World Exhibition of 1873

## Basic Information

The Vienna World Exhibition (Weltausstellung 1873 Wien) was held from May 1 to November 2, 1873, in the Austro-Hungarian capital. It was the fifth world exposition and the first to be held in a German-speaking country. The exhibition was designed to showcase industrial, cultural, and scientific achievements from around the world and coincided with Emperor Franz Joseph I's 25th anniversary as ruler.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie visited the Vienna World Exhibition during her stay in Vienna in August 1873. In her diary entries from August 11-15, 1873, she mentions visiting the "Exposition" several times. On August 13, she specifically notes visiting the "Agrikulturhalle" (Agricultural Hall) where she found her father's tobacco on display. She also mentions seeing Lefèvre's wine.

Her visits to the exhibition represent her family's participation in elite cultural events and their connections to European high society. The fact that her father's tobacco was displayed at the exhibition also indicates the family's economic interests and status.

## Historical Context

The Vienna World Exhibition faced significant challenges, including the stock market crash of May 1873 (part of the global "Panic of 1873") and a concurrent cholera epidemic, which severely impacted attendance. This may explain Marie's mention of her aunt's fear of cholera when Marie became ill on August 14.

The centerpiece of the fair was the Rotunda, the world's largest domed building at the time, surrounded by themed halls including the Palace of Industry and the Hall of Engines. National exhibits showcased both technological innovation and traditional arts, emphasizing cultural pride.

The exhibition aimed to elevate Austria-Hungary's status among major European powers like France and Britain. Despite financial difficulties and lower-than-expected attendance (about 7 million visitors compared to the projected 20 million), the exhibition succeeded in showcasing Vienna as a cultural and technological center.
