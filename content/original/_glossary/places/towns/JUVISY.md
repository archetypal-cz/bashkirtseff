The Juvisy family were Parisian acquaintances of Marie in October 1880. The family included a mother, and at least two daughters - "la petite Juvisy" (the younger Juvisy girl) and her sister.

The younger Juvisy daughter came to Marie for guitar lessons, visiting with her mother and sister. During one of these lessons, Marie played and sang for her, and the girl was astonished by the sweetness of Marie's voice - all that remained of Marie's once-beautiful singing voice after her illness.

The Juvisy family also attended social gatherings at Marie's home, visiting on October 16, 1880 along with the Tchoumakoff family.
