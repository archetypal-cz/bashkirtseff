## Identity

Akhtyrka (Ukrainian: Охтирка, Okhtyrka; Russian: Ахтырка) is a city in northeastern Ukraine, located on the Vorskla River in what is now Sumy Oblast. During the 1870s, it was the administrative center of Akhtyrsky Uyezd (district) in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire.

## In Marie's Diary (Book 00)

### Walitsky's Medical Service

Marie mentions Akhtyrka as the location where Dr. Lucien Walitsky served as district physician before joining the family:

> "Lucien Walitsky était polonais, russe sans patriotisme exagéré, une bonne nature, très câlin, qui se dépensait en charges d'atelier, à Akhtyrka où il était médecin du district."

("Lucien Walitsky was Polish, Russian without exaggerated patriotism, a good nature, very affectionate, who spent himself in studio antics, at Akhtyrka where he was district physician.")

This reference reveals:
- **Medical Administration**: Akhtyrka district had a formal medical system with district physicians
- **Professional Position**: Walitsky held official government position as district doctor
- **Rural Service**: District physicians served wide areas of countryside
- **Connection to Family**: Walitsky had been university friend of Maman's brothers
- **Regular Visits**: From Akhtyrka, he visited family estate "three or four times per year"

### Family Gathering Place - The Romanoff Scheme

In another passage from Book 00, Marie reveals that Akhtyrka served as a gathering place for family marriage schemes:

> "C'est à Akhtyrka où tout le monde s'installe, sauf grand-papa, que l'on trouva M. Romanoff."

("It was at Akhtyrka where everyone gathered, except grand-papa, that they found M. Romanoff.")

The family gathered there specifically to entrap the wealthy 40-year-old bachelor uncle [#Romanoff](Romanoff.md). The fact that Grand-papa did not join them suggests either disapproval or deliberate exclusion from the scheme.

This reveals Akhtyrka's role as:
- **Social Center**: Suitable location for family gatherings and social maneuvering
- **Neutral Territory**: Away from Grand-papa's direct oversight at Tcherniakovka
- **Staging Ground**: For the elaborate courtship that continued in nearby Kharkoff

## Geographic and Cultural Context

### Location
- **Northeastern Ukraine**: In Sloboda Ukraine region
- **Vorskla River**: Located on this tributary of the Dnieper
- **Distance from Estates**: Close enough to Bashkirtseff family properties for regular visits
- **Kharkov Governorate**: Administrative region in Russian Empire

### Sloboda Ukraine
Akhtyrka was part of Sloboda Ukraine (Free Ukraine), a historical region:
- Settled by Ukrainian Cossacks in 17th century
- Known for greater freedoms than other Ukrainian regions
- Distinctive administrative and cultural traditions
- Mix of Ukrainian and Russian influences

## Medical System (1870s)

The position of **district physician** (медицин округа) in imperial Russia:
- Government-appointed position
- Responsible for medical care across entire district
- Served both administrative role and direct patient care
- Often sole qualified doctor for large rural area
- Low pay, heavy workload, high prestige
- Required university medical education

Walitsky's position indicates his qualifications and explains both his connection to the region and his availability to accompany the family when they needed a physician for their European journey.
