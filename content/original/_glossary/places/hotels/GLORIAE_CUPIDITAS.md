Latin phrase meaning "Desire for Glory" that Marie uses as the title for what she considers the 82nd book of her diary. This marks the beginning of a new phase in her writing, coinciding with her return from the emotionally tumultuous Soden spa period in August 1878.

The title suggests Marie's pivot from romantic pursuits to artistic and intellectual ambitions following her disillusioning experiences with Prince Auguste and the social dynamics at the German spa. The Latin reflects her classical education and desire to elevate her personal narrative to a more philosophical or literary level.

This self-designation as her "82nd book" indicates Marie's awareness of her diary as a substantial literary work rather than mere personal recording.
