- **Nationality**: Argentine (father was Argentine)
- **Family**: Son of Monsieur de Gonzalès (called "le père Gonzalès" by Marie)

## The Gonzalès Family in Baden-Baden

### The Father (Monsieur de Gonzalès)

Marie describes him as an "Argentine Republican" ("République-argentinais Gonzalès"), suggesting he was either a diplomat or political figure from Argentina. Key characteristics:

- **Attracted to Marie's Mother**: "Le père Gonzalès devint amoureux de maman"
- **Character**: Initially rather vain about his perceived romantic success, but eventually came to understand Marie's mother's genuine innocence
- **Long-term Friend**: Despite the misunderstandings, he "became our friend" after "harsh surprises" taught him to understand Marie's mother

### The Mother (Madame de Gonzalès)

- **Jealous Wife**: Became jealous of her husband's attention to Marie's mother
- **Cold Demeanor**: Showed marked coldness ("très froide") to Marie's mother
- **Sharp Responses**: Made pointed remarks that Marie recognized as hostile, though her mother didn't

## The Triangle of Misunderstanding

Marie recounts an "almost incredible trait of naïveté" involving her mother and the Gonzalès couple:

1. Marie's mother, "free in her manner," had inspired confidence in Monsieur de Gonzalès
2. Madame de Gonzalès became jealous
3. Marie's mother befriended Madame de Gonzalès "in a frank, easy manner"
4. Madame de Gonzalès showed coldness, but Marie's mother "redoubled her amiability"
5. Marie's mother assumed the wife must be as charming as the husband (who was so nice to her)
6. Even at the train station farewell, Madame de Gonzalès made cutting remarks that Marie understood but her mother missed

Marie observes: "When I think of it now, remembering the expressions and intonations, it's astounding."

## Rémy's Romantic Entanglements

Young Rémy was caught between two interests:
- **Primary**: Berthe Boyd, his official "amoureux" (sweetheart)
- **Secondary**: Marie, to whom he would "steal a few moments from Berthe to make eyes at me"

This childhood love triangle mirrors the adult romantic complications happening between their parents.

## Social Class and Gambling

Marie makes a sharp class distinction in her retrospective:

> "She [Berthe] was connected with all the children of aristocratic families who knew her family. Mine knew no one and wallowed in roulette and trente-et-quarante."

The contrast between the socially-connected Gonzalès-Boyd children's group and Marie's gambling-obsessed family underscores Marie's painful awareness of social hierarchy.

## Historical Context

### Argentine Elite in Europe (1870s)

During the 1870s, wealthy Argentine families and diplomats frequented European spa resorts as part of the international circuit. Argentina's elite often had European heritage and maintained strong cultural and social ties to the continent.

### Baden-Baden as Meeting Place

Baden-Baden attracted an international mix of aristocracy, diplomats, and wealthy families. The Gonzalès family's presence there was typical of Argentine elite participating in European high society.

### Children's Society Mirroring Adults

The romantic entanglements among Rémy, Berthe, and Marie parallel the adult complications between their parents, showing how children in this milieu already practiced the social behaviors they would need as adults.

## Significance in Marie's Development

The Gonzalès family episode teaches young Marie several lessons:
1. **Social naïveté can be dangerous**: Her mother's innocence led to misunderstanding
2. **Gender politics**: Even children engage in romantic competition
3. **Class consciousness**: Family connections matter more than individual charm
4. **Observation skills**: Marie could read social cues her mother missed

The spelling "Gonzalès" (with accent) appears in Marie's text, though "Gonzales" (without accent) is more common in Spanish. This represents one of Marie's first observations of romantic rivalry and social manipulation. %%
