The Concerts Pasdeloup were popular Sunday orchestral concerts in Paris, founded in 1861 by conductor Jules Pasdeloup (1819-1887). They were known as "Concerts populaires de musique classique" (Popular Concerts of Classical Music).

**Historical significance:**

- Affordable ticket prices attracted large audiences

Marie attended these concerts with her aunt. On October 17, 1880, they left before the end because Marie wasn't feeling well and feared she might faint. When they returned home, they found Kiki and Saint-Amand had come during their absence.

The Concerts Pasdeloup were an important institution in Parisian musical life during the Second Empire and Third Republic, making them a natural choice for cultured Parisians like Marie and her aunt.
