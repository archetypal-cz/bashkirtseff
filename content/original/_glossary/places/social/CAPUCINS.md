The Capuchin monastery on rue de la Santé in Paris was one of many religious establishments affected by the anti-clerical laws of the early Third Republic. By November 1880, only three fathers (priests) remained there.

Marie visited the monastery in November 1880 to research for a painting she planned depicting "an expulsion of monks." The three remaining fathers showed her the locations of "the disaster" (the expulsion) and recounted what had happened.

Marie offered hospitality to two of the fathers at her family's property in Nice, though she hoped they wouldn't accept the offer.

**Historical context:**
The early Third Republic pursued aggressive anti-clerical policies, including:
- 1880: Dissolution of unauthorized religious congregations (Jules Ferry decrees)
- Expulsion of Jesuits and other orders
- Confiscation of religious properties

The Capuchins (Franciscan order) were among the religious communities targeted. Marie's painting project shows her engagement with contemporary political issues, though her sympathies (offering hospitality) suggest she found the expulsions unjust.
