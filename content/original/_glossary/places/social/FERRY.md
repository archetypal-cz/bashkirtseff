# Ferry

## Overview

Ferry appears to be a bootmaker or shoe merchant in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned briefly in Marie Bashkirtseff's September 18, 1873 diary entry when she comments on the quality of boots she is wearing.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Ferry in her September 18, 1873 diary entry:

> "Avant *tout* ils chantent une messe funèbre et me rendent méchante (robe écrue de Dina, bien), bottines de Ferry, charmantes."
> 
> (Before *everything* they sing a funeral mass and make me angry (Dina's ecru dress, good), boots from Ferry, charming.)

This brief parenthetical comment suggests that Ferry was a source of footwear that Marie found particularly pleasing. The description of the boots as "charmantes" (charming) indicates her satisfaction with their quality or style.

## Historical Context

In the fashion-conscious society of 1870s Nice, quality footwear was an important element of a well-dressed appearance. For a young woman of Marie's social class, having well-made, fashionable boots would have been essential for social occasions, promenades, and everyday wear.

Bootmakers and shoemakers in fashionable resort towns like Nice would have catered to a wealthy clientele, including both local aristocracy and international visitors. They would have been expected to produce footwear that followed the latest Parisian fashions while providing comfort and durability.

Women's boots in the early 1870s typically featured:
- Button or lace closures
- Medium to high heels
- Pointed toes
- Fine leather construction
- Decorative elements such as contrasting stitching or materials

Marie's appreciation for her "bottines de Ferry" suggests that this particular bootmaker or merchant provided products that met her high standards for style and quality.

## Business and Location

Without further mentions in the diary, it's difficult to determine whether Ferry was:

1. A local bootmaker who custom-made footwear for clients
2. A merchant who sold ready-made boots, possibly imported from Paris or other fashion centers
3. A brand name of boots that Marie purchased from a local shop

The possessive construction "bottines de Ferry" could indicate either that the boots were made by someone named Ferry or that they were purchased from a shop called Ferry.

In the context of Nice in the 1870s, it's most likely that Ferry was either a local artisan bootmaker or a shop specializing in quality footwear, catering to the wealthy international clientele that frequented the French Riviera during this period.
