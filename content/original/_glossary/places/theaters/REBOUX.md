## Overview

Caroline Reboux was one of the most prestigious milliners (hat makers) in Paris during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her boutique at 23 Rue de la Paix was established in 1865 and became the premier destination for fashionable hats.

## Historical Context

Caroline Reboux (1837-1927) founded her millinery house in 1865 and quickly established herself among Paris's elite fashion suppliers. By 1873, when Marie visits, Reboux was already well-known for:
- Simple, elegant designs
- High-quality materials (satin, felt, velvet, feathers)
- Tasteful embellishments rather than excessive ornamentation
- Clientele including Empress Eugénie and European aristocracy

## Location

23 Rue de la Paix - the same street as the House of Worth (No. 7), making it convenient for fashionable ladies to visit multiple prestigious establishments in one outing.

## Marie's Purchases

In August 1873, Marie orders a black felt hat for 85 francs (approximately $425-450 in modern currency). The high price reflects Reboux's luxury status - comparable to haute couture fashion houses like Worth.

Marie mentions that Reboux has lovely hats "pour les dames" but not necessarily for her (suggesting she finds them too mature or formal for a 14-year-old).

## Style and Influence

Reboux hats were known for:
- Understated elegance
- Perfect proportions and fit
- Following but also influencing fashion trends
- Longevity (the house continued operating until 1956)
