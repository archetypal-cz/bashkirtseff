## Overview

A dramatic theatrical work performed at the [French Theater of Nice](French_Theater_Nice.md) in January 1873. The play dealt with themes of religious persecution during the Inquisition.

## Performance Context (1873)

Marie Bashkirtseff attended a performance at the French Theater of Nice on January 18, 1873, where it was performed by [Méran](Meran.md). The title suggests a historical drama focused on the victims of the Spanish Inquisition - a popular subject for French theater during this period.

## Historical Context

Plays about the Inquisition were popular in 19th-century French theater, appealing to:
- Anticlerical sentiment in post-Revolutionary France
- Romantic fascination with historical persecution
- Dramatic potential of torture, martyrdom, and religious conflict

The subject matter would have been considered serious and educational, contrasting with the lighter comedies and operettas that also filled Nice's theatrical calendar.

## Later Cultural Reference

Interestingly, a silent film titled "Les martyrs de l'Inquisition" (also known as "Martyrs of the Inquisition") was made in 1905 by director Lucien Nonguet. This film, described as "a dramatic scene in five tableaux," depicted various methods of torture used during the Spanish Inquisition. While this is a different work from the 1873 theatrical production, it shows the enduring fascination with this subject matter.

## Research Notes
