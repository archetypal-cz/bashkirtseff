Marie's Italian language teacher who began lessons on March 17, 1872, in Nice. Marie mentions being satisfied with her Italian lessons as well as her English lessons on February 12, 1873.

## Teaching Context

Italian was an important language for:
- Opera appreciation (most operas of the period were Italian)
- Cultural sophistication
- Communication in Nice, which had only recently been annexed from Italy (1860)
- Travel in Italy, which was a common destination for wealthy families

## Timeline

The fact that Marie began Italian lessons in March 1872, just two months after beginning English, suggests a structured educational program supervised by her family.
