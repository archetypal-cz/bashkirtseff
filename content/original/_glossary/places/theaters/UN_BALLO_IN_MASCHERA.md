## Overview

*Un ballo in maschera* ('A Masked Ball') is an 1859 opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi with libretto by Antonio Somma, based on Eugène Scribe's libretto for Daniel Auber's 1833 opera *Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué*. It premiered at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on February 17, 1859, and was immediately successful.

## Historical Basis

The plot is based on the 1792 assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden, who was shot as the result of a political conspiracy while attending a masked ball. He died of his wounds thirteen days later.

## Plot Summary

The opera tells the story of King Gustavo III's tragic love for Amelia, the wife of his loyal secretary and friend Anckarström. Through visiting the fortune-teller Ulrica in disguise, Gustavus learns that Amelia loves him too, but also receives a prophecy that the man who next shakes his hand will be his killer - which turns out to be Anckarstroem.

When Anckarström discovers the affair between his wife and the king, he joins a conspiracy led by Counts Horn and Ribbing to assassinate Gustavo. Despite having decided to give up his love for Amelia, the king is murdered at a masked ball by Anckarström.

## Performance Context (1873)

Marie attended a performance of this opera at the [Nice Opera House](Opera_Nice.md) on January 11, 1873. The opera was a staple of the repertoire at European opera houses during the 1870s and would have been a prestigious cultural event for the winter season in Nice.

The themes of forbidden love, betrayal, and tragic destiny would have resonated with the young Marie, who was beginning to develop her own romantic fascinations, particularly with the [Duke of Hamilton](Duke_of_Hamilton.md).

## Musical Highlights

- Act III tenor aria "Ma se m'è forza perderti" (Gustavo's farewell to Amelia)
- Act II love duet "Oh, qual soave brivido" (first confession of love)
