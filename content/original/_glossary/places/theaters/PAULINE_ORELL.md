# Pauline Orell

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-23
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1881-02-24

An identity or persona adopted by Marie Bashkirtseff as a disguise.

## Diary References
- February 24, 1881: Marie disguises herself as "Pauline Orell" to visit the Folies-Bergère. She wears a thick veil and black wig (which makes her face look much broader). She tries on Alexis's male clothes but can't button them, so reverts to the female Pauline Orell disguise.

## Analysis
The choice of name suggests either:
1. An invented identity for this adventure
2. A reference to an actual person (actress, demimondaine, or other public figure)
3. A character from literature or theater

The disguise allows Marie to explore transgressive spaces (the Folies-Bergère's demi-monde) while maintaining a layer of protection and plausible deniability.

## Notes
Further research needed to determine if "Pauline Orell" refers to a real person or is purely Marie's invention.
