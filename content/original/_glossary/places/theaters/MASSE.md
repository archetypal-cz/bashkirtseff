## Historical Context
Massé was a successful opera composer in Second Empire and early Third Republic France, with works performed at major Parisian theaters including the Opéra-Comique.

## His Opera "Paul et Virginie"
Premiered at the Théâtre Lyrique in 1876, this opera adapted the beloved 1788 novel by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre about two young people raised together on Mauritius Island whose innocent love ends tragically.

## Diary References
- February 17, 1881: Marie says the music of "Paul et Virginie" makes her want to cry, praising how "Massé a magnifiquement compris le poème" (Massé magnificently understood the poem). The music moves her deeply, especially when she reflects on her lost youth and isolation.

## Marie's Response
The opera's themes of innocent love and lost paradise resonate powerfully with Marie's sense of her wasted youth and social isolation.
