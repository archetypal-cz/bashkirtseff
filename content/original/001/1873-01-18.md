%% 2025-12-07T10:50:00 LAN: "cercle" - 1870s: social club, NOT circle. Cercle Masséna was an exclusive gentleman's club that hosted balls %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:51:00 LAN: "énormément de monde" - an enormous crowd/huge number of people. Intensifier showing social success of event %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:52:00 LAN: "au Français" - at the French (Theater). Shortened form of "Théâtre Français" common in period usage %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:53:00 LAN: "s'est approché de moi" - approached me, came up to me. Formal social approach requiring acknowledgment %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:54:00 LAN: "presque rien" - almost nothing. Marie's elliptical style: she felt almost nothing for Boreel %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:55:00 LAN: MARIE'S STYLE: "Etrange !" - Strange! Single-word exclamation shows her self-analytical nature. She's surprised by her own emotions %%
%% 2025-12-07T16:20:00 RSR: Cercle Masséna was named after Napoleon's marshal born in Nice - a prestigious social club. "Les martyrs de l'inquisition" was a serious historical drama, contrasting with the comedies Marie usually attended. Marie's cooling feelings toward Boreel show her self-awareness and emotional maturation. %%
%% 2025-03-23T00:27:10 RED: This entry provides insight into Nice's social scene and Marie's changing attitudes. The Cercle Masséna was a prestigious social club[^01.21.1], and the mention of her mother dancing suggests the family's full integration into society life. The theatrical performance of "Les martyrs de l'inquisition" indicates the kind of dramatic entertainment popular at the time. Marie's reaction to Boreel - "presque rien... Etrange!" - shows her growing emotional sophistication and self-awareness, as she analyzes her own changing feelings. The ellipsis and exclamation create a contemplative yet surprised tone. %%
Au cercle Masséna, énormément de monde. Maman a dansé. Le soir, au Français, "Les martyrs de l'inquisition", par Méran. Boreel s'est approché de moi, mais moi, presque rien... Etrange !
[^01.21.1]: The Cercle Masséna was named after André Masséna, one of Napoleon's marshals who was born in Nice. It was an important social institution where the local aristocracy and wealthy visitors gathered for balls, concerts, and other cultural events.
