## Code-Switching
Marie's English is exceptionally heavy in Carnet 012 (Hitchcock's influence):
- Nov 10 entry is the most English-heavy in the entire diary so far
- English passages marked with ==highlight== and footnoted
- Italian: "basta" (Nov 19), "per voler esser certo..." (Dante, Nov 13)
- Code-switches include: "a beast to home," "fidgets me," "stiff," "weather," "Scotch," "quite comfortable," "posted," "waterproofs," "contempt," "contemptible creatures," "nonsenses," "Nice is a worthless place"

## Translation Decisions
- "toilette" = dress/outfit (per TranslationMemory)
- "canaille(s)" = scoundrel/riffraff (context-dependent)
- "comme il faut" = proper/properly (translated, not kept in French, per context)
- "saisonniers" = seasonal visitors (italicized)
- "sainte-nitouche" = butter-wouldn't-melt
- "tu t'encanailles" = you are degrading yourself
- "marrons ou nefles" = chestnuts and medlars (Marie's metaphor for worthless people)
- "morceaux de bois" = blocks of wood (stubborn people)
- "bataclan" = crowd
- Structural markers: [Crossed out:], [In the margin:], [Annotation:], [Written across the page:]
- Racine quotation (Phedre V.6) preserved and footnoted
- Dante quotation (Paradiso XXIV) preserved and footnoted
