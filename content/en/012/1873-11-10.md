%% Tous ces jours pluies torrentielles, mais aujourd'hui il fait beau. Je prenais ma lecon d'anglais, Walitsky ouvre furieusement la porte, se precipite avec un cahier de musique : "Dedie a Mme la duchesse de Hamilton, princesse de Bade" s'ecrie-t-il comme un fou et s'en va. Hitchcock demande ce que c'est, je dis que je n'en sais rien mais Walitsky entre et dit: %%
All these days, torrential rains -- but today the weather is fine. I was having my English lesson when Walitsky flings open the door, rushes in with a sheet of music -- "Dedicated to the Duchess of Hamilton, Princess of Baden!" he cries like a madman, and leaves. Hitchcock asks what it is about; I say I have no idea, but Walitsky comes back in and says:

%% 2026-02-19T11:02:00 TR: "goodness" is Marie's English exclamation. %%
The horses come and we go out with Paul; there are a great many people, but how wretched Nice is to live in permanently! To come for the month of the races as if on an outing -- that is charming. But to live here! Oh, ==goodness.==

%% Mon cheval patine, joue et fait meme trop de betises, il ne voulut pas avancer et se mit a tourner et monta sur le trottoir, avec peine je le fis marcher. Mais vers la fin il alla si bien que I am quite delighted. Il faisait presque sombre, on allumait les lanternes, alors nous avons trotte, mais ce cheval est vraiment charmant. Je l'habitue a trotter, nous avons passe presque toute la promenade au trot, j'allais tres bien, tres bien en arrivant a la maison j'ai declare que je brule d'une flamme nouvelle pour.... moi. %%
%% 2026-02-19T11:03:00 TR: "I am quite delighted" and "je brule d'une flamme nouvelle pour... moi" -- the English is Marie's, the French joke is about falling in love with herself after a good ride. %%
My horse skids, plays up, and even makes too much mischief -- he would not go forward and began to spin round and mounted the pavement; with difficulty I got him to walk. But towards the end he went so well that ==I am quite delighted.== It was almost dark; they were lighting the lanterns, and then we trotted. But this horse is truly charming. I am training him to trot; we passed nearly the whole promenade at a trot. I was going very well, very well -- on arriving at the house I declared that I burn with a new flame for... myself.

%% Nous trottions a piu non posso et je ne permettais pas d'arreter: Go on, Jennings, go on ! C'est mon cri de guerre. Un cocher aux courses a Paris encourageait Jennings lorsqu'ils (ces chevaux) passaient et touchaient presque au but: Go on Jennings go on. Je ne cessais de le repeter, et je le repeterai longtemps, ce sera mon tic et mon sapristi instead of chiens. Au jardin un ventre a terre comme aux courses. Quel charme ! Je monte l'escalier en amazone et une face ecarlate, et on m'apprend que M. Tormosoff est chez nous. Solominka est aussi au salon, elle toute rouge, excited, et bouleversee. Pauvre bete ! On parle des Mme Beketoff; voila une femme qui me plait. Elle ecrit a Tormosoff qu'elle passera l'hiver au Caire, la bienheureuse ! %%
%% 2026-02-19T11:04:00 TR: "a piu non posso" = Italian, "to the utmost." "Go on, Jennings, go on!" is English, Marie's new catchphrase from the Paris races. "sapristi" = mild oath (euphemism for "sacre"). "en amazone" = in riding habit/sidesaddle. "excited" is Marie's English. %%
We were trotting ==*a piu non posso*== and I would not allow a stop: ==Go on, Jennings, go on!== That is my war-cry. A coachman at the races in Paris was urging on Jennings as they (those horses) were passing and nearly reaching the finish: ==Go on, Jennings, go on!== I could not stop repeating it, and I shall repeat it for a long time; it will be my catchphrase and my oath instead of "dogs." In the garden, a full gallop as at the races. What bliss! I climb the stairs in my riding habit with a scarlet face, and they tell me that M. Tormosoff is with us. Solominka is also in the salon, quite flushed, ==excited,== and in a state. Poor creature! They speak of Mme Beketoff -- there is a woman after my own heart. She writes to Tormosoff that she will spend the winter in Cairo, the blessed woman!

%% A diner je bois pour etonner Miss Hitchcock un verre de vin rouge et d'eau, ensuite un quart de verre d'eau-de-vie, tout a la fois. Alors je deviens gaie, et pour repeter tout ce que j'ai dit... ma foi, j'y renonce. Je sais seulement que j'ai ri, elle a ri, nous avons ri, ils ont ri. Au salon ensuite, Walitsky fait de la musique. Comme il joue bien, c'est un charme. A diner j'ai depeint le duc de Hamilton. He has cow's legs, pig's face and a hippopotamus's back. Red hair, red face, little eyes. Awful. %%
%% 2026-02-19T11:05:00 TR: "He has cow's legs, pig's face and a hippopotamus's back. Red hair, red face, little eyes. Awful." -- all in English in Marie's original, her deliberately grotesque description of Hamilton to deflect suspicion. %%
At dinner I drink, to astonish Miss Hitchcock, a glass of red wine and water, then a quarter glass of brandy, all at once. Then I become gay, and to repeat all I said... upon my word, I give it up. I know only that I laughed, she laughed, we laughed, they laughed. In the salon afterwards, Walitsky plays music. How well he plays -- it is a charm. At dinner I depicted the Duke of Hamilton: ==He has cow's legs, pig's face, and a hippopotamus's back. Red hair, red face, little eyes. Awful.==

%% Comme je voudrais rester avec tous, on chante, mais les lecons, cette plage de la vie humaine. Les ayant finis je vais dire bonsoir, et on commence a faire mon eloge, about my studies, physique, chimie, etc. etc. et Bete commence a louer ma face, a dire que je suis blanche. Beaucoup me l'ont dit, mais je ne le croirai jamais, (Maman a vu le prince Gagarine). %%
%% 2026-02-19T11:06:00 TR: "plage" is likely "plaie" (plague/affliction) -- Marie's misspelling or the scribe's error. "about my studies" is her English code-switch. %%
How I wish to stay with everyone; they are singing. But lessons -- that plague of human life. Having finished them I go to say good night, and they begin to praise me -- ==about my studies,== physics, chemistry, etc., etc. -- and Bete begins to praise my face, to say I am fair. Many have told me so, but I shall never believe it. (Maman has seen Prince Gagarin.)

%% Son Mobile a gagne le premier prix a Porchefontaine, (Page) . C'est la premiere fois depuis Bade que je le vois gagner un premier prix. Je regarde sa photographie a la lumiere, je ne vois que la nuque, mais... je vois dans moi-meme sa figure, si vivante, naturelle. %%
His Mobile won first prize at Porchefontaine. It is the first time since Baden that I see him win a first prize. I look at his photograph by the light; I see only the back of his neck, but... I see within myself his face, so vivid, so natural.

Surtout manger n'est pas convenable pour moi qui suis si malheureuse. Mais je suis ainsi.

Mon cher *Hippopatamus* nous nous rever... %%
%% 2026-02-19T11:07:00 TR: "con maggior forza" = Italian musical term, "with greater force." "Hippopatamus" -- Marie's deliberate misspelling, affectionate nickname from her own insult. "nous nous rever..." = unfinished, likely "reverrons" (shall see each other again). %%
I love him so! I do not know why... I am stupid. I am so miserable, and at the same time I laugh, I sing, I eat. Especially eating is not seemly for one who is so miserable. But I am like that. I die for an instant and in a second I am gay, lively, and mad, and when I am at the height of madness I fall back ==*con maggior forza*== into ennui, into grief. My dear *Hippopatamus,* we shall see each oth--
