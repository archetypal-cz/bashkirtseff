%% Beau temps. A la promenade avec Mme Markevitch qui loge en bas chez nous, il y a deux mois. Mlle Collignon est malade, elle a perdu sa voix et peut à peine parler, je ne sais si c'est un rhume ou c'est son Indien; je l'appelle ainsi because he was in India to make his fortune, always promising to marry her when he shall be rich enough. As if could not work being married, I think better than alone. She believed and he is married and l'a plantée là . We went again to the port for I very much wished to know, whose yacht it was we have seen yesterday. We passed it twice. In the first time, Dina and Markevitch did not notice it for I attracted their attention on the spot where a few months ago there was an éboulement fearing to blush. The second time, Dina exclaimed " Oh there is a yacht, how lovely, whose it is". I only wanted for that, and immediately offered to ask, the carriage stopped. Dominique, our coachman said: "C'est au duc de Hamilton". Every boat is for him that of the Duke of Hamilton. We asked of a man, and he said he knows not. Dominique asked if it was not the Duke I But the man answered (en vieux patois) he knows his perfectly and everybody knows then. I muttered some words against him: "Oh ! *ici on le connaît, c'est vraiment un ivrogne, il tombait très souvent, tous les gens du peuple le connaissent, un épouvantail*." %%
Fine weather. At the promenade with Mme Markevitch, who has been lodging downstairs with us for two months. Mlle Collignon is ill; she has lost her voice and can barely speak — I do not know if it is a cold or her Indian. I call him so, ==because he was in India to make his fortune, always promising to marry her when he shall be rich enough. As if one could not work being married — I think better than alone. She believed, and he is married and *l'a plantée là*.[^2] We went again to the port, for I very much wished to know whose yacht it was we had seen yesterday. We passed it twice. The first time, Dina and Markevitch did not notice it, for I attracted their attention to the spot where a few months ago there was an *éboulement*,[^3] fearing to blush. The second time, Dina exclaimed: "Oh! there is a yacht, how lovely — whose is it?" I only waited for that and immediately offered to ask; the carriage stopped. Dominique, our coachman, said: "C'est au duc de Hamilton."[^4] Every boat is for him — that of the Duke of Hamilton. We asked a man, and he said he knows not. Dominique asked if it was not the Duke's, but the man answered (in old dialect) that he knows him perfectly and everybody knows him. I muttered some words against him: "Oh! *here they know him well — he is truly a drunkard; he fell very often; all the common people know him — a scarecrow.*"==[^1]

If even he drinks, to another I would never have forgiven it, but in him it is charming. I would talk to him, sooth his fury when drunk, suffer all his *excès*. I am sure he will love me I no I If God will I would make him, with God's help, the happiest man. But all I shall do will with His help, as ask Him for everything. %%
