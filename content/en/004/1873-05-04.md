The Howards came — Madame, Hélène, and several others. Hélène is a charming girl. I showed her my paintings, my studio, my study, where we talked almost the whole time. ==We spoke of friends; she had but one, a very peculiar girl who never told what she really thought, but always the contrary.==[^1]

%% I said I had none, only one whom I should like it is Bertha Boyd. I love her, but we were acquainted only for three or four weeks, and then we parted, and God knows when we shall meet again. I told her my tastes, she hers, we are a little ressemblantes. We spoke of the society of the Boutovsky girls, she said they have always secrets, it is that kind of girls' secrets in the room's corners, letters, boys, each has a *soi-disant* lover, such funny little people I said, I wish to go to Florence, and so I really wish where I can study singing, piano, painting. But in Nice it is almost impossible, for want of galleries, museums, conservatoires. %%

%% Then we went to music, very windy and hot weather. I passed two pages behind and must return. Hélène said she wanted we stay next winter in Nice. I said, I will come for race time, and she will see the complete reform of toilette, instead of riches, complete simplicity as it becomes to a young lady, she would not believe. Then we conveyed her at home, and returned to the music. But met the countess de Mouzay and her daughter, we cross them in carriage and after the music they wanted to go to countess Benvenuti and as mamma was her several visits. I went too. She is very amiable. But that stupid bataclan all these women with their dogs. It is a peculiar race of titled women not of high society with their white dogs, and as I call them *Les comtesses du troisième étage aux visites canines* for they always come with two or more white little dogs. We spoke in the carriage of the misses White ! They go too much out, said I, I should like them to be one season in mourning to prevent them from doing so. For if we go rarely, our presence is appreciated and our absence noticed. But the White are quite lauded à cause de cela. I should like their mother to be more severe Mme de Daillens said, they much ill treated their mother that it is quite revolting. On récolte ce que l'on sème. %%
