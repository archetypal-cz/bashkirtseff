And at my lessons, when I read, 1 am so miserable that 1 do not understand the half of what I read, being in continuous anxiety to meet "Duke".

If he only knew how troubled I am for his sake at dinner, at breakfast, at every moment when I am with mamma, my aunt, and all the house. I hold my handkerchief near the mouth, in case if "Duke" comes and particularly Hamilton to affect that I cough or something of that sort. I never sit down to be ready to go out if his name will be said or something about his family, because I am instantly red, trembling and say quite the contrary of what I wish to say. %%
