- English passages marked with ==highlight== and footnoted
- Italian passages translated with footnotes
- Russian words kept as-is when naturalized (datcha, prissiadka)

## Translation Decisions
- "toilette" = dress (per TranslationMemory)
- "gentille" = pretty (context-dependent)
- "canaille" = scoundrel/riffraff/wretched creature (per context)
- "cocotte" = courtesan/kept woman
- "comme il faut" = kept in French (italicized)
- "protecteur" = protector (euphemism preserved)
- "fille" = prostitute (when used as social designation)
- Marie's invented words preserved with [sic]: "meprisation [sic]"
- Structural markers: [Crossed out:], [In the margin:], [Two lines cancelled], [Annotation:]
