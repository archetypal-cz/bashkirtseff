%% Je ne dis rien, je ne puis rien dire ! Je suis trop malheureuse pendant les leçons je devais retenir les larmes. Je vois tout ce que j'ai imaginé et à quoi j'ai rêvé se réaliser mais pas pour moi hélas ! C'est une autre. Il ne manquerait plus qu'elle ait des chevaux de course, et je sens que cela arrivera. Oh ! J'étouffe ! %%
I say nothing; I can say nothing! I am too unhappy -- during my lessons I had to hold back tears. I see everything I imagined and dreamed of being realized -- but not for me, alas! It is another woman. The only thing missing is for her to have racehorses, and I feel that it will come to pass. Oh! I suffocate!

==Aristocracy and yeomanry mustered in great force, attracted by the fact that so many sportsmen were to take part in the [blotch] [chase?]. The young people, who looked remarkably well, included the Duke of Hamilton and a large party of Royal and noble friends to the place of meeting.==

==This evening the Duke and Duchess of Manchester give a ball in a spacious tent erected within the precincts of the castle. Messrs Coote and Tinney supply the music, and invitations have been sent out to all the principal families in Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, and Northamptonshire. The usual custom of giving the dance after the wedding is departed from on this occasion, in order that the bride and bridegroom may mix among their friends, which they could not do tomorrow night, as after the wedding they will go to spend their honeymoon at the Duke of Hamilton's Suffolk estate, Easton Park.==
