%% We have seen the villa Durando, it is really magnificent but a little too far. It would suit us to buy it, but to here it is too far. And 1 don't want to buy anything in Nice. We shall stay this winter and then we go to Italy, to Florence or Naples I don't know which. Oh 11 hope this winter we will know him, and then I will know where he passes the most of his time, and there we shall go. All the happiness of my life is in this winter for if we go to another place, how can I know if we meet him. And in Nice he comes every winter, so there is a capital hope. But, have I forgotten ? Oh ! how stupid ! It is all the same where we go and where provided God be with me and helps me it is all that is wanted. If He has risolved to make me happy, He will in spite of all. And it makes a difference only in my feeble mind where we shall be. %%
