%% 2026-02-12T17:02:00 TR: French opening translated, English continuation preserved verbatim. "son Indien" → "její Indián" (her Indian — Marie's ironic nickname for Collignon's faithless suitor). "l'a plantée là" preserved in French within English text as in original. "éboulement" preserved in French within English text. "un épouvantail" → preserved in French within English (local man's words). Marie's fear of blushing — "fearing to blush" — is the pivot to English. %%
%% Beau temps. A la promenade avec Mme Markevitch qui loge en bas chez nous, il y a deux mois. Mlle Collignon est malade, elle a perdu sa voix et peut à peine parler, je ne sais si c'est un rhume ou c'est son Indien; je l'appelle ainsi because he was in India to make his fortune, always promising to marry her when he shall be rich enough. As if could not work being married, I think better than alone. She believed and he is married and l'a plantée là . We went again to the port for I very much wished to know, whose yacht it was we have seen yesterday. We passed it twice. In the first time, Dina and Markevitch did not notice it for I attracted their attention on the spot where a few months ago there was an éboulement fearing to blush. The second time, Dina exclaimed " Oh there is a yacht, how lovely, whose it is". I only wanted for that, and immediately offered to ask, the carriage stopped. Dominique, our coachman said: "C'est au duc de Hamilton". Every boat is for him that of the Duke of Hamilton. We asked of a man, and he said he knows not. Dominique asked if it was not the Duke I But the man answered (en vieux patois) he knows his perfectly and everybody knows then. I muttered some words against him: "Oh ! *ici on le connaît, c'est vraiment un ivrogne, il tombait très souvent, tous les gens du peuple le connaissent, un épouvantail*." %%
Krásné počasí. Na promenádu s paní Markevičovou, která bydlí dole u nás, už dva měsíce. Slečna Collignon je nemocná, ztratila hlas a stěží mluví, nevím, jestli je to rýma, nebo její Indián; říkám mu tak, because he was in India to make his fortune, always promising to marry her when he shall be rich enough. As if could not work being married, I think better than alone. She believed and he is married and l'a plantée là. We went again to the port for I very much wished to know, whose yacht it was we have seen yesterday. We passed it twice.
