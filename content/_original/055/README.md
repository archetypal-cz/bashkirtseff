# Carnet 055 — French Original

<!-- WORKER: @kerray since 2026-02-04 -->

## Summary

Carnet 055 of Marie Bashkirtseff's diary. Marie is in Rome throughout, first at the Hôtel de Londres, then moving to the Hôtel de la Ville on Via del Babuino (around March 14). The carnet charts the Antonelli-Torlonia romantic triangle: Antonelli's passionate love declarations, the discovery of Torlonia's identity and fortune, and Marie's cold-blooded analysis of marriage prospects. Climaxes with the Duke of Hamilton revelation in the final entry.

**Date range**: 1876-03-01 to 1876-03-27
**Entry count**: 27
**Location(s)**: Rome
