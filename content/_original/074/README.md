# Carnet 074 — French Original

## Summary

Carnet 074 of Marie Bashkirtseff's diary.

**Date range**: 1877-08-20 to 1877-09-25
**Entry count**: 37
**Location(s)**: Paris, Schlangenbad, Wiesbaden

## Notes

- Entry "Mardi 10 septembre 1877" (file `1877-09-11.md`) has an incorrect date in the manuscript — Marie wrote "10 septembre" but it was actually September 11 (the previous entry is correctly dated "Lundi 10 septembre"). The filename uses the corrected date; the title preserves Marie's original text.
- Two entries have date headers only with no diary text: 1877-09-16 and 1877-09-20.
- "Dimache 9 septembre" preserves Marie's original spelling (missing 'n' in Dimanche).
