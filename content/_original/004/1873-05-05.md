Beau temps. A la promenade avec Mme Markevitch qui loge en bas chez nous, il y a deux mois. Mlle Collignon est malade, elle a perdu sa voix et peut à peine parler, je ne sais si c'est un rhume ou c'est son Indien; je l'appelle ainsi because he was in India to make his fortune, always promising to marry her when he shall be rich enough. As if could not work being married, I think better than alone. She believed and he is married and l'a plantée là . We went again to the port for I very much wished to know, whose yacht it was we have seen yesterday. We passed it twice. In the first time, Dina and Markevitch did not notice it for I attracted their attention on the spot where a few months ago there was an éboulement fearing to blush. The second time, Dina exclaimed " Oh there is a yacht, how lovely, whose it is". I only wanted for that, and immediately offered to ask, the carriage stopped. Dominique, our coachman said: "C'est au duc de Hamilton". Every boat is for him that of the Duke of Hamilton. We asked of a man, and he said he knows not. Dominique asked if it was not the Duke I But the man answered (en vieux patois) he knows his perfectly and everybody knows then. I muttered some words against him: "Oh ! *ici on le connaît, c'est vraiment un ivrogne, il tombait très souvent, tous les gens du peuple le connaissent, un épouvantail*."

Local man disparages the Duke as a drunkard known to all locals as "un epouvantail" (scarecrow). Marie secretly delighted by evidence the Duke is known locally. Mlle Collignon recalls seeing him in Cairo joking with donkey-drivers. %%
Je le disais for others, but in my mind I was delighted to hear they know him. He must be very kind, popular, he likes to joke with common people, Mlle Collignon said, in Cairo he was always "avec des âniers en petites voitures disant des bêtises".

%% 2026-02-03T10:01:00 LAN: "exces" - French: excesses (drinking bouts) %%
Oh ! he must be a jolly fellow, he is not a rigid and frigid English I He is a polisson. Je l'adore for all, for his character, and all. I am sure he is the most charming man, oh he is a splendid fellow ! Oh I do not know how to express what I think of him, I will try: charming, spiritual, gay, beautiful, joking, prideless with low people majestic, noble, a splendid fellow I repeat again. If even he drinks, to another I would never have forgiven it, but in him it is charming. I would talk to him, sooth his fury when drunk, suffer all his *excès*. I am sure he will love me I no I If God will I would make him, with God's help, the happiest man. But all I shall do will with His help, as ask Him for everything.

There is a comte Lauch of the Pigeon shooting and Duke's bataclan, who always so much looks at me, I am sure he wanted to know who we were, for to-day we met him with M. Randouin, who nous a salué, and seeing he seized him by the arm as if to ask. "Oh I who is it ? Can you introduce me, I could not find anybody who knew them Perhaps. Randouin will direct him to somebody who knows us. For we know almost nobody of the society. We only know Russians, old, ill-dressed people ! I do not wonder if many gentlemen were not

introduced, they knew nobody who knew us. Oh - Perhaps God will be so good as to make us know Lambertye and then next year at the Rgeon shooting and pei+iaps earlier he will make us know the Duke of Hamilton. Oh I I am mad of joy ! Perhaps my prayers are heard by Him and it is His providence who caused us to meet Lambertye with Randouin. Oh God, as we stay again this winter here, do not make it in vain, make me know him I You are so great - You are so good for me, I am your spoiled child, if I may say so. Oh I how 1 love him, never in my life I shall love so again, for this is the first time, and I [prayl God will the last. God I *Seigneur ! Seigneur ! Ne m'abandonne pas I* Hear ! Hear my humble voice. Can it reach to You almightly God ? Hear it. Listen to me !
