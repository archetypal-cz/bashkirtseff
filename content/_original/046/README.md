# Carnet 046 — French Original

<!-- WORKER: @kerray since 2026-02-04 -->

## Summary

Carnet 046 of Marie Bashkirtseff's diary. A ten-day period dominated by the aftermath of Audiffret's departure with Gioia, the exposure of Saetone as an entremetteur, and Marie's extraordinary philosophical self-examination. Features Marie's satirical poem "Prediction de Cassandre" (26 stanzas), the establishment of a code-name system (Feu, le Torrent, la Rosee, la Neige), extended reflections on power, cynicism, and ambition, and a devastating scene of despair ending with self-contemplation in a mirror.
