%% 2026-02-09T22:03:00 RSR: Single-line entry. Marie's mother and cousin Dina have arrived in Paris from Nice — this is the direct result of Marie's desperate letter of March 31, in which she demanded her mother come and help her establish social connections. Their arrival will change the household dynamic significantly for the rest of this carnet. %%
