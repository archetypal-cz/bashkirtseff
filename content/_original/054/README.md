## Key Themes

- **Roman Carnival 1876**: Marie experiences masked balls at the Capitoline and Teatro Apollo
- **Romantic triangle**: Antonelli (desired), Bruschetti (pursuing), Doria (coup de foudre)
- **Social exclusion**: The family lawsuit prevents entry into Roman society
- **Audiffret**: Still pining for him in Nice, writes satirical letters
- **Painting**: Marie paints ciociara models in Rome

## What's Done

- All 18 entries: frontmatter updated with correct location (Rome), entities, standardized format
- RSR comments added to all entries with significant content
- Glossary tags added to key paragraphs
- Fixed incorrect locations (was "Nice"/"Paris"/"Vienna" → all "Rome")
- Fixed paragraph ID error: 054.0110 → 054.1100 in 1876-02-29
