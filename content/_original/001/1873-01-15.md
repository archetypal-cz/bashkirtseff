Bonne promenade à cheval. Le soir, à l'Opéra. J'ai vu en y allant la voiture du duc de Hamilton. Ah ! si seulement il pou­vait venir à la maison, je suis sûre que je serais belle ce jour- là !

%% 2025-12-07T16:18:00 RSR: Marie's horseback riding shows her aristocratic accomplishments. Her belief that she would be "belle" if the Duke visited reveals her romantic notion that strong emotions could enhance beauty. The sighting of his carriage intensifies her obsession. %%
%% 2025-03-23T00:26:58 RED: This brief entry captures several important aspects of Marie's character and daily life. Her horseback riding shows her privileged lifestyle and accomplishments as a young lady of society. The sighting of the Duke's carriage and her immediate emotional reaction demonstrates her growing infatuation. Her comment about being "belle ce jour-là" reveals both her self-consciousness about her appearance and her belief that strong emotions could enhance her beauty - a romantic notion typical of her age and era. The exclamation "Ah!" and the use of the conditional tense ("si seulement") create a wistful, yearning tone that characterizes many of her entries about the Duke. %%
