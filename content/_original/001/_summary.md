## Editorial Summary

%% SUM.001.0002 %%
This first carnet of Marie Bashkirtseff's preserved diary covers one month in Nice during the winter social season of 1873. The central preoccupation is Marie's intense, unrequited obsession with the Duke of Hamilton, a wealthy Scottish aristocrat she observes at the opera, on the Promenade des Anglais, at horse races, and at the Monaco pigeon shooting. Marie never speaks to the Duke, yet fills her pages with detailed observations of his appearance, his carriage, his yacht, and his movements. A fortune-telling game at the theater predicts she will become "duchesse de Hamilton," which only intensifies her fantasies.

%% SUM.001.0003 %%
Marie simultaneously maintains a secondary romantic interest in Alfred Boreel, a young man of uncertain nationality whom she initially mistakes for a baron. Her analysis of her feelings for both men is remarkably sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old. She distinguishes between the simple "joie" (joy) she feels when seeing Boreel versus the "rayon de soleil qui penetre dans mon coeur" (sunbeam that penetrates my heart) when she glimpses the Duke. She acknowledges Boreel is teaching her "la methode" (the method) of making oneself interesting, treating her romantic life as a subject for psychological study.

%% SUM.001.0004 %%
The carnet also reveals Marie's literary self-awareness. She reflects on her own diary-writing, acknowledging her spelling difficulties while predicting (accurately, as it turned out) that her notebooks will become "un document important pour la litterature et pour la posterite." She notes with embarrassment that her earlier writing style was "tout simplement abominable," demonstrating critical distance from her younger self even at age thirteen. Her celebration of her birthday (actually her name day, January 24) anchors the narrative temporally, as does her note about beginning English lessons with Mlle Collignon in January 1872.

## Historical Context

%% SUM.001.0006 %%
Nice in the winter of 1873 was one of Europe's premier resort destinations for aristocracy and wealthy families seeking the mild Mediterranean climate. The city had been annexed by France from the Kingdom of Sardinia only in 1860, and by the 1870s it had become the fashionable winter capital for an international elite that included British lords, Russian nobles, and continental aristocracy. The Promenade des Anglais served as the daily stage for seeing and being seen, where carriages and riders paraded in the afternoon.

The Bashkirtseff family - Russian minor nobility living abroad after the parents' separation - had settled in Nice's Villa Baquis. Marie's household included her mother Maria Stepanovna, her cousin Dina, her governess Mlle Collignon, and various servants. The family participated fully in Nice's winter season: attending the opera, riding horses, visiting other families, and making the short trip to Monaco for events like the prestigious pigeon shooting competitions that attracted Europe's wealthiest sportsmen.

%% SUM.001.0008 %%
%% [#DUKE_OF_HAMILTON](../_glossary/people/core/DUKE_OF_HAMILTON.md) %%
The Duke of Hamilton whom Marie so admires was William Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845-1895), one of Scotland's wealthiest noblemen. He was known for his sporting interests, his yacht, and his extravagant lifestyle - all details Marie captures accurately. He would marry Lady Mary Montagu later in 1873, unbeknownst to the young diarist.

## Reading Notes

%% SUM.001.0010 %%
Readers approaching this carnet should note several key patterns:

%% SUM.001.0011 %%
**The unrequited gaze**: Marie's relationship with the Duke exists entirely in observation and fantasy. She watches him from her terrace, from her carriage, from theater boxes - but never speaks to him. This establishes a pattern of idealization and projected romance that will recur throughout her diaries.

%% SUM.001.0012 %%
**Self-aware analysis**: Despite her youth, Marie constantly analyzes her own emotions with unusual precision. She asks herself whether she truly loves the Duke or merely desires his wealth and title. She admits when she is being "folle" (foolish) even while continuing in her folly.

%% SUM.001.0013 %%
**Class consciousness**: Marie is acutely aware of social hierarchies. Her disappointment upon learning Boreel is not a baron, her calculations about which suitor is wealthier, and her concern about formal introductions all reveal the marriage-market mentality of her milieu.

%% SUM.001.0014 %%
**The diary as companion**: Marie explicitly treasures her diary-writing, describing the "delicieux bonheur" (delicious happiness) of rereading her entries alone in her room at night. The diary functions as both confidant and literary project.

%% SUM.001.0015 %%
**Later annotations**: Some entries include annotations Marie added in 1884, eleven years later, usually mocking her younger self's "stupidite" and "ingenuity." These provide a poignant counterpoint to the breathless entries of 1873.
