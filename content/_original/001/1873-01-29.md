%% 2025-12-07T16:45:00 RSR: A rare entry without mention of the Duke - showing Marie's daily routine. Horseback riding (aristocratic accomplishment), music practice (likely piano), and English lessons with Mlle Collignon. Marie's passionate nature shows in "galopé pendant des heures" - she does everything with intensity. %%
%% 2025-03-23T00:28:47 RED: This brief entry provides a glimpse into Marie's daily life and accomplishments. Her horseback riding shows her privileged lifestyle, while her music practice and English lessons demonstrate her dedication to her education[^01.61.1]. The enthusiastic description of her ride ("splendide") and the energetic "galopé pendant des heures" reveal her passionate nature, even when describing activities unrelated to the Duke. This entry serves as a reminder that despite her romantic obsession, she maintained an active life of her own. %%
Promenade à cheval, splendide. J'ai galopé pendant des heures, puis j'ai fait de la musique et le soir de l'anglais.
[^01.61.1]: Marie's English lessons with Mlle Collignon had begun on January 12, 1872, as noted in a previous entry. This consistent study would later enable her to write parts of her diary in English.
