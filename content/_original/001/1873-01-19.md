Dans la voiture, j'ai vu le duc de Hamilton. La première fois après cinq semaines. Il nous dépassa pour aller chez Gioia. J'ai commencé à battre la mesure du pied, je rougissais, mais moins que d'habitude, grâce à Dieu, il pleuvait presque et le landau était à moitié fermé. Je vois tout d'un coup le duc de Hamilton.

%% 2025-12-07T16:25:00 RSR: First sighting of the Duke in 5 weeks - Marie has been counting. "Chez Gioia" - the Duke was visiting his mistress, Gioia (a courtesan). Mlle Collignon is Marie's English governess who manages her education. Marie's physical reactions (foot-tapping, blushing) show her youth and lack of self-control despite her sophisticated observations. %%
%% 2025-03-23T00:27:23 RED: This entry introduces several important elements. First, we meet Mlle Collignon[^01.25.1], Marie's governess, whose reaction shows both concern for and irritation with her young charge's obvious infatuation. The mention of "cinq semaines" indicates Marie has been counting the time between sightings of the Duke, revealing the depth of her fixation. Her physical reactions - foot-tapping, blushing - and her relief at the partially closed landau suggest both her self-consciousness and her awareness of social propriety. The Duke's destination "chez Gioia" refers to his mistress, adding a layer of complexity to Marie's romantic fantasies. %%
Mlle Collignon, voyant que je rougissais, me dit d'un ton presque sévère: "Ne faites pas cela, Marie, cela m'énerve tant." Il a passé vite et regardant devant lui.

[^01.25.1]: Mlle Collignon was Marie's English governess who played a significant role in her education and social development. Her presence in these entries reflects the typical arrangement for young ladies of Marie's social class, who were educated by private governesses.
