%% 2025-12-07T10:30:00 LAN: "jolies toilettes" - beautiful outfits/dresses, NOT pretty toilets. "Toilette" = complete dress ensemble in 1870s %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:31:00 LAN: "notre loge" - our box (at theater/ball). Private viewing areas for wealthy families at events %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:32:00 LAN: "ne m'amuse plus" - no longer entertains/amuses me. "Amuser" in 1870s had broader meaning: to interest, engage, divert %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:33:00 LAN: "Et dire que" - idiomatic: And to think that! Expression of disbelief or irony %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:34:00 LAN: "sa démarche" - his gait/bearing/manner of walking. Period term encompassing physical deportment and social manner %%
%% 2025-12-07T10:35:00 LAN: "au fond" - at bottom, fundamentally, deep down. Marie's introspective expression %%
%% 2025-12-07T16:15:00 RSR: Bal Floréal was a prestigious social event in Nice. Boreel is a young man Marie had previously been interested in, but she's now losing interest - his "démarche" (gait/bearing) displeases her. This shows Marie's critical eye for physical details and mannerisms. %%
%% 2025-03-23T00:26:44 RED: This entry introduces Boreel as a contrasting figure to the Duke of Hamilton in Marie's romantic interests. The mention of the Floréal ball and her observation about the lack of beautiful dresses shows her keen attention to social events and fashion. Her pink dress marks a departure from the blue dress mentioned in previous entries, perhaps reflecting her changing mood. The comment about Boreel's "démarche" (gait/bearing) reveals both her attention to physical details and her growing sophistication in judging potential suitors. %%
Ce bal Floréal a amené beaucoup de monde, mais pas de jolies toilettes. Moi, en robe rose. Un grand nombre de per­sonnes sont venues nous voir dans notre loge. Boreel ne m'amu­se plus beaucoup. Et dire qu'il m'a tellement intéressée ! Au fond je crois que c'est sa démarche qui me déplaît.

[^01.16.1]: The Floréal balls were significant social events in Nice during the winter season, attended by both local aristocracy and wealthy visitors.
