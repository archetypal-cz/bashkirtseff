%% 005.0097 %%
%% 2026-02-03T10:24:00 LAN: ENGLISH paragraph - apartment hunting %%
%% 2026-02-03T13:00:00 RSR: All day apartment hunting - entry in English. Key requirement: garden big enough for croquet. Villa Durando magnificent but too far. Plans: stay in Nice this winter, then Italy (Florence or Naples). Marie hopes to learn where the Duke spends most time, then follow him there. "All the happiness of my life is in this winter" - believes God will arrange meeting if He wills it. Resumed studies. Teaching Palajka to read Russian. %%
All the day was spent in looking for an apartment and nothing suits us; if the house is large enough, the garden is too small for I want my croquet placed in the garden, and it is a new and great difficulty.

%% 005.0098 %%
Many apartements have suited us but for the croquet. I think *Rubioni* is convenient enough.

%% 005.0099 %%
%% 2026-02-03T10:24:00 LAN: ENGLISH paragraph - dreams of meeting the Duke %%
%% 2026-02-03T10:24:00 LAN: "risolved" - Marie's spelling of "resolved" %%
%% 2026-02-03T10:24:00 LAN: "capital hope" - excellent hope; period expression %%
We have seen the villa Durando, it is really magnificent but a little too far. It would suit us to buy it, but to here it is too far. And 1 don't want to buy anything in Nice. We shall stay this winter and then we go to Italy, to Florence or Naples I don't know which. Oh 11 hope this winter we will know him, and then I will know where he passes the most of his time, and there we shall go. All the happiness of my life is in this winter for if we go to another place, how can I know if we meet him. And in Nice he comes every winter, so there is a capital hope. But, have I forgotten ? Oh ! how stupid ! It is all the same where we go and where provided God be with me and helps me it is all that is wanted. If He has risolved to make me happy, He will in spite of all. And it makes a difference only in my feeble mind where we shall be.

%% 005.0100 %%
Today I have resumed my studies, and have begun to teach Palajka to read in Russian.
