%% 2026-02-03T12:30:00 RSR: Arrival in Geneva at 11am - Marie delighted to see cathedral she drew last year. Shock at seeing Paul at school: his voice has changed dramatically (sounds 17 though only 13.5), long brown curls made him ugly until he got shaved at hotel. Visit to Sapogenikoffs - Marie dislikes their daughters (secrets, letters, boys). Croquet playing. Krumling dispute continues - M. Yourkoff finally mediates. Spotted M. Gros on Rue de Corraterie. Entry mostly in English. OCR error "Webeakfasted" for "We breakfasted". Stayed at Hotel de la Couronne (not the preferred Metropole). %%
At eleven o'clock the next morning we reached Geneva and when I saw the cathedral, which I have drawn last year from nature, 1 was delighted to see it. My eyes were brilliant and my face animated. From the railway station we took a coach and we drove directly to the school where Paul is. We came at last. I was waiting in the parlour when I heard a rude voice in the antichamber and a lad of about seventeen sprang in the carriage when mamma was waiting.

It was Paul, a big boy, with brown curls on his shoulders, he was so ugly in this coiffure that I could not look at him until we came to the hotel and while I was taking my bath, he was shaved. When he reentered the room he was quite different, he was the boy whom I left one year ago only very much grown. Oh ! how much is a coiffure. He is only thirteen and half and he looks seventeen or more. His voice is very rude even disagreeable, it is so altered that I cannot recognize it at all; just as if the voice of somebody else is now in Paul and his is gone. Webeakfasted at the hotel; I dressed myself (robe écrue, chapeau mousquetaire, fatiguée mais bien) and then went on foot to Mme Sapogenikoffs, mamma, Paul and I. She was not at home, the children were alone. Marie is as little as she was, Olga is a little taller. I don't like that sort of girls, secrets, little letters, signs, sighs, glances with the boys. There is a boy who lives with them.

We played at croquet. I much enjoyed it, for we were all good players, I am a little disaccustomed of the game, and for the first time played very awkwardly, but after a little while I was much better. Then came Mme Sapogenikoff and after M. Yourkoff. I have a bad headache, and was almost unable to speak and answer to the jokes. 1 scarcely understood what they said. Then at home. The goldsmith Krumling came for this affair. They disputed, counted, après avoir [fait] des soustractions, des divisions, des multiplications etc. etc. etc. They have done nothing, for mamma was very impatient and would not listen to what he said. Then very happily came M. Yourkoff, for the relief. And he also after loosing his patience several times at last made them (mamma and Krumling) understand.

I am very glad indeed that it is ended.

On our return from the school, the carriage was half closed. When on the rue de Corraterie I see M. Gros, ah ! but I was so surprised and astonished, I made a stupid exclamation as alway when I see somebody whom I saw in another place. He did not see us, he will be I am sure very glad to see us. How stupid I am ! That Gros is the last of the last for me, a mere I don't known what, a man whose I merely saw in the street, and to whom I do not feel the slightest sympathy, and yet I am glad (only glad howewer, for I always use such exaggerated expressions) to meet him. Now we are seated in the room it is half past eleven, I, Paul and mamma, reasoning on what Paul will be and what profession he will adopt. To my great disappointment we did not go to the hôtel de la Métropole but to the hôtel de la Couronne. I wished very much to go to the Metropol.
