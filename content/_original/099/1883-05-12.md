%% 099.0363 %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:01 LAN: "atelier" - studio; the Academie Julian where Marie studied %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:02 LAN: "ces dames" - these ladies; fellow women art students at the academy %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:03 LAN: "j'attrape" - I catch/grab; colloquial for getting someone's attention briefly %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:04 LAN: "gamins" - street urchins; Marie's painting of working-class children %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:05 LAN: "bien-pensante" - right-thinking, conventional; the mainstream respectable opinion (often slightly ironic) %%
Je passe la matinée à l'atelier à causer avec ces dames et j'attrape un instant Julian pour le prier de venir voir les gamins. Vous comprenez je ne veux pas de conseils, mais seulement l'impression du public, or Julian représente la majorité bien-pensante.

%% 099.0364 %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:06 LAN: Editorial note - Summary of extended text covering: Julian's reaction to street children painting; six figures with tall boy showing something to five grouped around him; street visible with small girls leaving; advice to remove lamp from corner; painting original, amusing; discussion of Holy Women composition - twilight, blurred contours, Magdalene in profile, other Mary showing despair; difficult emotional rendering; Julian predicts honorable mention %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:07 LAN: "gavroche" - street urchin becoming adolescent (original text reference); from Victor Hugo's character in Les Miserables %%
%% 2026-02-02T08:08:08 LAN: "mention honorable" - honorable mention; Salon award below medal; important recognition for emerging artists %%
%% 2025-11-23T16:07:00 RSR: Entry from Book 15, raw carnet lines 5729-5767. Note: Morning studio time with ladies; asks Julian to see children figures; doesn't want advice, only public impression - Julian represents right-thinking majority; children painting shows six figures with tall one showing something to five grouped around him; street visible far away with 2-3 little girls leaving; Julian advises removing street lamp from left corner - correct assessment; finds work original, amusing, nearly certain success, better than salon's two children; appreciates main child's street urchin quality becoming adolescent; regarding women Marie explains understanding; Julian thinks paintings could have great effect, encourages about Holy Women; Marie discusses time of day - twilight with blurred contours, contrast, figures retreating, Magdalene in profile elbow on knee staring at tomb, other Mary standing collapsed in hands showing explosion of tears/weariness/despair; difficult rendering woman's stupor/revolt/desperation - complex emotion; asks if possible to attempt; Julian predicts honorable mention as certain thing; Saint Women painting entirely in her head from moment she conceived it. %%
