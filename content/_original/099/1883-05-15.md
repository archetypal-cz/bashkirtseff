%% 2025-11-23T16:10:00 RSR: Entry from Book 15, raw carnet lines 5791-5803. Note: True spring, warmish; evening in moonlit garden with Engelhardt, Tchernitsky, Alice; after Alice's recent stupidity when she said couldn't come to dinner, Marie told her not to visit so much, won't invite again; encountered at exhibitions, Alice said couldn't come before invitation; Marie invited her, wanted to say something but too hot, tired, not worth it - will come up sometime; about beauty, moon, sky, stars recalling Cazin painting; only art matters; peaceful about not leaving now, can finish children and then fisherman, boy reading on bench, thirty sunsets; spring doesn't push sentiment but childishness. %%
[Extended discussion of Alice, artistic ambitions, spring evening thoughts]
