Il fait si chaud qu'on ne vit que le soir. Je me suis imaginée que Bastien allait venir et naturellement il n'est pas venu, alors je monte chez moi, très heureuse de tout cet étage tranquille, avec l'infini du ciel...

%% 2025-11-23T16:11:00 RSR: Entry from Book 15, raw carnet lines 5805-5833. Note: So hot only living in evenings; imagined Bastien would visit naturally didn't come; climbs to studio happy with quiet space and infinite sky; spring pushes to childishness not sentiment; Rosalie warns will end badly, habit of telling Coco you'll end badly; gets up from bed instead of sleeping, wears bathrobe to walk studio, plays with Coco; says she despises him, passing carriages are condolence visits because despised him; railroad whistle and church bell sounds; poetic on beautiful evenings should do countryside parties on water or devil knows where with what people; thinks of Paris Champs Elysees Bois living while in America there; questions throwing youth to ambitions, will reap capital returns; whistle very harmonious at night, people returning from countryside tired dreamy happy drunk exhausted; whistle always; when famous maybe within year, very patient like sure; must have more confidence before Bastien-Lepage, must show understanding; rarely see each other, don't know what saying; if were hers like Harlequin how would that be, excitement conditional local not complete subject like Gambetta; whistle always; recall Dominique in Paul et Virginie about coming storm; difficult reading Balzac in these mind states but reading nothing else to avoid getting worked up; still bell and whistle. %%
