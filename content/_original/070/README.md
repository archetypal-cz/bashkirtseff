## What's Done

- Research: All 8 entries researched with RSR comments, frontmatter updated, language tags added
- Annotation: LAN annotations present from previous pass (2026-02-02)
- Structural cleanup: Removed duplicate old-format paragraph blocks from 5 entries (1877-04-08, 1877-04-22, 1877-04-23, 1877-04-24, 1877-04-25)
- Note: 1877-04-03 still has old-format `[//]: # ( 10.XXX )` markers interspersed within text (not duplicated, just mixed formatting). Needs entry-restructurer pass.
- Note: Several glossary entries are miscategorized (places under `people/mentioned/` instead of `places/`): SORRENTO, VILLA_REALE, AQUARIUM, CHIAJA, CASTELLAMARE, TOLEDO, CHAMP_DE_MARS, PAUSILIPPE, SKATING, COURSES, CERCLE, SOCIETA_FILARMONICA, CONSULAT. Also FAUST should be under `culture/`.
