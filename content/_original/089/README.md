## Notes
Original notebook held at Bibliotheque de Cessole, Nice (not BnF).

Tome 13. Marie is in Paris for June-July, travels to Mont-Dore (thermal spa in Puy-de-Dome, Auvergne) from July 19 to August 21, then returns to Paris.

Combined entry: 1880-09-30 covers both "Jeudi 30 septembre 1880" and "Vendredi 1er octobre 1880" (filed under the first date).

The entry for September 28 (1880-09-28.md) contains OCR artifacts from a two-column page layout in the original manuscript. The letter to the baron and surrounding narrative text were interleaved by the OCR. This needs manual cleanup during the research phase.

Missing entries: September 11-13 (noted "[Manque du 11 au 13 septembre 1880]" in the source).
