# Book 00 - Preface (Předmluva)

## Structure Note

This "book" is Marie Bashkirtseff's **retrospective preface** written in **May 1884**, approximately five months before her death. It is **one continuous text**, not daily diary entries.

The files are **arbitrarily split into segments** for workflow convenience:
- `1884-05-01.md` / `1884-05-01-01.md` → Part 1 (paras 00.01-00.05)
- `1884-05-02.md` / `1884-05-01-02.md` → Part 2 (paras 00.06-00.10)
- etc.

The duplicate naming (`1884-05-0X.md` vs `1884-05-01-0X.md`) exists for historical reasons. Both contain identical content.

## Translation Output

Czech translations use numbered parts (not fake dates):
- `cz/00/00-01.md` → Part 1
- `cz/00/00-02.md` → Part 2
- etc.

## Rendering

When rendering Book 00, display as **one continuous preface**, not as separate dated entries. The section breaks are for editorial convenience only.
