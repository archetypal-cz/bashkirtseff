Le Droit des Femmes (Women's Rights Society) was a feminist organization in Paris during the late 19th century, led by Hubertine Auclert. The society advocated for women's suffrage, legal equality, and social reforms.

## Historical Context
Founded in the late 1870s, the society held regular meetings to discuss feminist issues and political strategy. Members debated questions of political participation, alliance with other progressive movements, and tactics for advancing women's rights.

## Organizational Culture
Members addressed each other as "citoyen/citoyenne" (citizen) in the republican tradition. The society included both moderate and more radical members, leading to debates over tactics and alliances.

## Diary References
- February 16, 1881: Marie attends an evening meeting where members debate whether to participate in Victor Hugo's celebration. Vote is close: 7 against, 6 for. One member (Citoyen Bal) attacks Victor Hugo, claiming he could have done as well with leisure and money.

## Marie's Involvement
Marie aligns with Hubertine Auclert's moderate position, voting for participation. She speaks briefly at meetings and appears to value Auclert's measured approach over more radical positions.

## Notes
Marie's participation shows her genuine engagement with feminist causes, despite her aristocratic background and social position.
