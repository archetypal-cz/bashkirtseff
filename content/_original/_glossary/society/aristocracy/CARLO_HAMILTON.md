## Diary References

### 1874
- **April 30**: Marie spots him at Place Masséna heading toward rue Masséna. "C'est Carlo, Carlo... oh Dina!" Cannot say full name "Carlo Hamilton" due to strangers present. Describes: "cette tournure d'Apollon, cette taille et cette tête petite et belle." Says he's gained weight and improved: "Il a engraissé et embelli ce cher Carlo, ce don Juan badois!" More graceful than Duke because taller and thinner. "Il rappelle son frère" but Duke still superior. Called member of "cette race hamiltonienne" - unmistakably Hamilton.

## Physical Description
- Tall, well-built ("grand, bien fait")
- Perfectly dressed ("parfaitement mis")
- Dark-haired ("brun," "cheveux noirs")
- Fine features ("traits fins")
- Noble chin and neck ("le menton et le cou gras et nobles")

## Carriage Accident (1875)

In August 1875, Marie learns that Carlo Hamilton has been gravely injured or killed in a carriage accident in St. Petersburg. He had obtained a divorce for Mme Paskevitch and was about to marry her when his horses bolted on Nevsky Prospect. He was thrown from the carriage in a pitiful state; doctors despaired of saving him. Marie is deeply moved: "Pauvre Carlo, au moment d'etre heureux!" She empathizes particularly with Paskevitch's suffering.
