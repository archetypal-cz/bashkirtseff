**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1873-05-03

Younger brother of the Duke of Hamilton. Marie spots him driving in Nice on April 16, 1873, and cries out in surprise before covering by claiming Mlle Collignon stepped on her foot. She sees Lord Carlos as a potential connection to his brother - through him she could learn the Duke's whereabouts and speak about him.

## Physical Appearance
Marie describes him as "tall, slim, dark" ("grand, mince, brun") but notes "he has nothing of his brother."

## In the Diary
- **April 16, 1873**: Marie spots him in a carriage on the bridge. She cries out "Oh! Carlos Hamilton!" and blushes when teased about her reaction.
- **April 19, 1873**: Sees him again while shopping; Walitsky teases her about not jumping from the carriage.

Marie writes: "I love him like my brother. I love him because he is his brother. Oh! I would like to know him, from him I could learn where the other is, with him I could speak of the other."

**2025-12-07T17:00:00 RSR: Marie's interest in Lord Carlos is purely instrumental - as the Duke's brother, he represents a potential link to her beloved. She has no romantic interest in Carlos himself.**
