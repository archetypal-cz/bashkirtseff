Abaza was a prominent Russian nobleman whom Marie knew during her time in Russia. He was described as "the biggest bigwig of Poltava" after having previously held important positions in St. Petersburg and Odessa.

In October 1880, Abaza and Manderstern (the marshal of nobility for the province) sent Marie a telegram congratulating her on her father's unanimous election to some position in Poltava. The telegram read: "All the nobility presents you through us its congratulations on the occasion of your father's unanimous election. We drink to your health. - Abaza, Manderstern."

Marie responded with a dignified, formal telegram thanking "the worthy interpreters of the Poltava nobility" - maintaining proper diplomatic tone regarding family affairs while showing herself polite to these influential figures, noting she might need to present her own candidacy in Poltava someday "when we have moved forward."

The name Abaza likely indicates Georgian or Caucasian origin (common among Russian nobility).
