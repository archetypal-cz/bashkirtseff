## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 22, 1873**: Marie sees Boreel walking and conversing with Nastia during the promenade. The fact that Marie notes this encounter suggests she may have felt a twinge of jealousy or at least interest in who was receiving Boreel's attention.

## Notes

"Nastia" is a Russian diminutive form of Anastasia, suggesting this was likely a member of the Russian colony in Nice. The informal use of the nickname indicates either familiarity on Marie's part or that this was how the person was commonly known in their social circle.
