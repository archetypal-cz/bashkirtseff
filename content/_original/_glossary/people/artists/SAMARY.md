Jeanne Samary (1857-1890) was a celebrated French actress at the Comédie-Française, known for her beauty, charm, and infectious laughter. She became one of the most popular actresses in Paris during the 1870s-1880s.

Marie compares herself to Mlle Samary in October 1880, saying "I am always very gay and very droll for others, I laugh as much as Mlle Samary of the Théâtre Français, but it's more a habit than a mask." This reveals that Samary was famous for her laughter and gaiety - qualities Marie felt she displayed outwardly even while suffering inwardly.

**Notable facts:**
- Renowned for her roles in comedies at the Comédie-Française
- Immortalized in several portraits by Auguste Renoir (1877-1878)
- Known for her vivacious personality and sparkling laugh
- Represented the charm and elegance of Parisian theatrical life

The comparison suggests Marie saw herself as performing cheerfulness while privately experiencing despair over her deteriorating health.
