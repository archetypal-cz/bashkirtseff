## Relationship with Marie

Marie provides a remarkably detailed physical and professional portrait in carnet 083:
- **Age**: 42 in 1878, looking 35
- **Appearance**: Pale, dark-haired, bearded, blue eyes, large firm features
- **Health**: Slightly consumptive (which disgusted Marie)
- **Character**: Excellent temperament, gentle and slightly mocking manners
- **Teaching**: Very severe about work but softened severity with "unctuous pleasantries and paternal smiles"
- **Marie's reaction**: Initially intimidated (blushing when speaking to him), later more comfortable
- **Sculpture mentorship**: Offered to visit Marie at home to advise on her sculpture work

Marie notes that Breslau "adores him in secret" and that "they all adore him a little." Marie herself is careful to state she has never said whether he is young or old, black or white - maintaining analytical distance despite evident fascination.

## Significance in Diary

Robert-Fleury represents legitimate artistic authority and mentorship. His willingness to provide private sculpture lessons shows recognition of Marie's talent. He serves as both teacher and inadvertent object of the female students' admiration.
