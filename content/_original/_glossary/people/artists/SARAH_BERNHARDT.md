## Connection to Marie

Bernhardt represented the kind of fame and independence Marie herself craved. As a woman who achieved extraordinary success in a male-dominated world through sheer talent and force of personality, Bernhardt was both a cultural phenomenon Marie would have admired and a standard against which she measured her own aspirations. The fact that Bernhardt also practiced sculpture made her even more relevant to Marie's own multi-talented ambitions.

Bernhardt and Marie moved in overlapping Parisian circles. Bastien-Lepage, who became Marie's friend, painted Bernhardt's famous portrait. The theatrical world that Bernhardt dominated was one Marie attended regularly and wrote about in her diary.
