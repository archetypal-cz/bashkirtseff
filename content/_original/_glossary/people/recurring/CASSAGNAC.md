## Overview

Paul Adolphe Marie Prosper Granier de Cassagnac (1842-1904) was a French journalist, politician, and duelist. He was a prominent Bonapartist and editor of *Le Pays*, known for his fierce political writings and numerous duels.

## Historical Background

### Career
- **Journalist**: Editor of *Le Pays* (pro-Bonapartist newspaper)
- **Politician**: Deputy in the National Assembly, ardent defender of Napoleon III's legacy
- **Duelist**: Famous for fighting numerous duels over political disputes
- **Polemicist**: Known for aggressive, provocative writing style

### Political Position
- **Ultra-Bonapartist**: Unwavering supporter of the Second Empire and Napoleon III
- **Anti-Republican**: Fierce opponent of the Third Republic
- **Conservative**: Defended traditional social hierarchies

### Social Position
Despite his political prominence, Cassagnac's social standing was complicated:
- From wealthy but not aristocratic background
- His father's immense fortune from unknown sources
- His journalistic career was considered somewhat déclassé by old aristocracy
- His dueling reputation added both glamour and notoriety

## Relationship with Marie Bashkirtseff

### Romantic Interest (1878-1879)
Marie was strongly attracted to Cassagnac and considered him a potential match:
- **Physical attraction**: She found him handsome and commanding
- **Intellectual appeal**: His political passion and literary abilities impressed her
- **Social calculation**: His connections could advance her position
- **Ambition**: She believed "avec lui je serais une force" (with him I would be a power)

### Disillusionment (April 1879)
In Book 13, Marie learns disturbing information about Cassagnac:
- **Marital scandals**: Affairs and domestic troubles with his wife Julia
- **Hungarian mistress**: Ongoing extramarital relationship
- **Hypocrisy**: His public moralism versus private behavior
- **Rejected dowry**: Claim of refusing 5 million franc dowry "because there was a stain in the family"

Marie's reaction:
> "Alors, c'est ainsi mon pauvre Cassagnac... tu es un sale personnage à l'intérieur ? Et c'est ce particulier-là qui nous racontait avoir refusé une dot de cinq millions"
> (So that's how it is, my poor Cassagnac... you're a dirty character inside? And this is the man who told us he refused a dowry of five million)

### Her Regret
Marie reflects on missed opportunity:
> "A-t-il été bête Popaul ? Quel idiot. Avec moi il serait devenu tout au monde"
> (How stupid Popaul was! What an idiot. With me he would have become everything)

This reveals both her ego and her genuine belief in her potential as a partner for an ambitious man.

## Historical Verification

Paul de Cassagnac did marry Julia (exact details require further research). His reputation for both political dueling and personal scandal was well-established in contemporary Paris.

## Significance in Marie's Development

Cassagnac represents:
- **Marie's political phase**: Her Bonapartist sympathies (later evolving)
- **Romantic pattern**: Attraction to powerful, established men
- **Social learning**: Understanding the gap between public reputation and private reality
