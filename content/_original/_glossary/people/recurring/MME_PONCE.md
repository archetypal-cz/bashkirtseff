Madame Ponce was Marie's guitar teacher, whom Marie refers to as "ma négresse" (my negress) - likely indicating she was of African or mixed-race origin. She taught Spanish songs and guitar.

On November 19, 1880, instead of giving Marie a lesson at home, Marie invited her to the atelier where Mme Ponce performed Spanish songs with her guitar for about an hour. The gas lights were lit, and fifteen women students, presided over by Julian himself, sat at the back of the atelier while Mme Ponce stood on the model's table amid applause.

This unconventional performance at the atelier shows both Marie's status (able to organize such an event) and the bohemian atmosphere that could prevail at the Académie Julian.

The reference to "ma négresse" reflects period racial attitudes, though Marie's warm relationship with her teacher (inviting her to perform for the atelier, taking regular lessons) suggests genuine respect for her musical talents.
