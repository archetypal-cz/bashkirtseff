# Denis Family

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-23
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1880-11-21

French family in Marie's Paris social circle in 1880. Both the father ("le père Denis") and mother ("la mère Denis") visit Marie.

**References in diary:**
- 1880-11-21: The father and mother Denis visit Marie at her home on Sunday afternoon, arriving after Saint-Amand, the Tchoumakoff ladies, Berthe, and Mme Engelhardt.

The casual mention suggests they were regular visitors or family friends. The fact that both parents visit together may indicate they were calling on Marie's aunt as much as on Marie herself, as was customary for family friends.

**Social context:**
- Part of Marie's regular Paris visiting circle
- Both parents make social calls together
- Likely bourgeois or upper-class family given their social connections
