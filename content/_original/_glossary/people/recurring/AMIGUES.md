Amigues was a Bonapartist political figure active in Paris in 1880, working alongside Paul de Cassagnac in support of the Imperial cause.

In October 1880, during the political crisis over Bonapartist succession, Marie notes that "Cassagnac and Amigues shamefully announced they were absolutely foreign to the reunion [at Cirque Fernando] after which they celebrated in their newspapers 'the great act of the people of Paris' etc."

This refers to a Bonapartist meeting at the Cirque Fernando where several hundred men decided to send twelve delegates to demand that Prince Napoleon ("Plon-Plon") submit or abdicate in favor of his son Prince Victor. Cassagnac and Amigues denied involvement in organizing the meeting while simultaneously praising it in their newspapers - a contradiction Marie found hypocritical.

The incident illustrates the internal conflicts within the Bonapartist movement in the early Third Republic, as well as Marie's increasingly critical view of Cassagnac's political maneuvering.
