**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1874-04-30

## Overview

The Howard family was one of the closest and most frequently mentioned families in Marie Bashkirtseff's 1873 diary. They appear to be English or Anglo-Irish expatriates living in Nice, though there is a notation "Howard (Russe)" on February 28, 1873, suggesting they may have been Russians with an anglicized name, or perhaps English people who had lived in Russia, or a mixed family. They maintained a warm friendship with the Bashkirtseff family throughout this period.

## Notable Events

### 1873
- **January 11, 1873**: "Les Howard étaient venus me chercher" - came to fetch Marie
- **February 21, 1873**: The Howard daughters came to fetch Marie at 9 AM for a horseback ride to Carabacel. Marie's horse Coco misbehaved, and Mrs. Howard kindly accompanied Marie home afterward
- **February 27, 1873**: Marie's mother tells her "Now with the Howards it's finished, the Tutscheff are there" - the Howards had a dinner party to which the Tutscheff were invited but the Bashkirtseffs were not. This snub clearly stung
- **February 27, 1873** (later same day): Despite the earlier snub, when Marie encounters the Howard daughters and their mother during her promenade, they are exceptionally friendly, taking her arms on both sides and walking with her to buy gloves
- **February 28, 1873**: Marie visits the Howard residence (described as "Howard (Russe)" suggesting they were actually Russian despite the English name). There she meets Mlle Betalli
- **Regular Visits**: Constant presence throughout 1873
- **Gift Exchanges**: Marie buying presents for the Howard children
- **Shared Activities**: Promenades, shopping, social calls

### 1874
- **April 20**: Dance at Howards with Boutowsky family present
- **April 30**: Visit from 4-6pm. Marie confronts Hélène about gambling rumors spread by Mrs. Howard. They reconcile and plan Sunday visit. Howards leaving Wednesday. Hélène claims Marie corseted due to "grosseur" - Marie insists naturally thin. Lise defends Marie's figure.

## Social Position

The Howards appear to be:
- **English/British Expatriates**: Part of the British colony in Nice, though possibly with Russian connections
- **Wealthy**: Able to maintain the same social activities as the Bashkirtseffs
- **Well-Connected**: Part of the international social scene

The shifting nature of Marie's relationship with them - from friendly horseback riding to being excluded from a dinner party to warm encounters the next day - illustrates the delicate and sometimes volatile social relationships among the aristocratic visitors to Nice.

## Historical Context

British families like the Howards were common in Nice during the 1870s:
- Nice was a popular wintering spot for wealthy British families
- The British had established churches, clubs, and social networks
- Many came for health reasons or to enjoy the climate
- Formed close friendships with other expatriate families

The notation "Howard (Russe)" suggests the complex international nature of Nice's winter colony, where national identities could be fluid and families might have connections across multiple countries.

## Questions for Further Research

- What was Mr. Howard's profession or source of wealth?
- Were they permanent residents or seasonal visitors?
- What happened to the friendship in later years?
- Is Bête definitely a Howard family member?
- What explains the "Howard (Russe)" notation - were they Russians with an English name?

%% 2026-02-11T13:10:00 RSR: Per Kernberger (2013), the Howards were "M. and Mme Howard: Anglo-Russian family living in Nice" with daughters "Hélène, Lise, and Aggie." Mme Howard's first name was Julie Stepanovna (identified by patronymic in some entries). This confirms the "Howard (Russe)" notation: they were indeed an Anglo-Russian mixed family. %%
