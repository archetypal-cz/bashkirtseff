## Relationship with Marie

Marie first met Bojidar (and his brother Alexis) in August 1879 at Dieppe, where she had traveled for health treatment. The Karageorgevitch brothers became part of Marie's social circle.

In autumn 1883, Marie painted a portrait of Prince Bojidar, demonstrating both her artistic skill and their continued friendship.

## Significance

Bojidar represented the kind of aristocratic connection Marie valued — a prince of a royal house, albeit one in exile. The Karageorgevitch family was part of the network of exiled European royalty that frequented the same circles as Marie's family.
