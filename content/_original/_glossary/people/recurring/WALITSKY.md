**Diary Coverage**: Book 00 (1884 retrospective), Book 02 (1873)

## Identity

Dr. Lucien Walitsky (also spelled Walitzky) was a Polish-Russian physician who served as district doctor at Akhtyrka in Ukraine before becoming the Bashkirtseff family physician and traveling companion during their European journey beginning in 1870.

## Background and Professional Life

Marie provides a detailed portrait in her 1884 retrospective (Book 00):

> "Lucien Walitsky était polonais, russe sans patriotisme exagéré, une bonne nature, très câlin, qui se dépensait en charges d'atelier, à Akhtyrka où il était médecin du district. Il avait été à l'université avec les frères de maman et fut de tous temps de la maison, venant trois ou quatre fois par an à la campagne."

("Lucien Walitsky was Polish, Russian without exaggerated patriotism, a good nature, very affectionate, who spent himself in studio antics, at Akhtyrka where he was district physician. He had been at university with mama's brothers and was always part of the household, coming three or four times a year to the countryside.")

### Key Characteristics
- **Polish origin**: But Russian by citizenship
- **Non-political**: "Without exaggerated patriotism"
- **Affectionate nature**: "Très câlin" (very affectionate)
- **Playful personality**: "Se dépensait en charges d'atelier" (spent himself in studio antics/pranks)
- **District Physician**: Held official government medical position at Akhtyrka
- **University educated**: Studied medicine with Marie's maternal uncles
- **Long-term family friend**: Regular visitor to family estates

## Relationship with the Family

Marie describes his exceptional devotion:

> "C'était chaque fois une joie folle pour tout le monde. Il avait un culte fraternel, admirable et saint pour maman qui le traitait en enfant chéri."

("It was each time a wild joy for everyone. He had a fraternal, admirable and holy devotion for mama who treated him as a cherished child.")

> "Cet homme admirable fut toujours pour chacun de nous un second soi-même."

("This admirable man was always for each of us a second self.")

This profound bond made him an integral part of the family unit, not merely an employee.

## Joining the European Journey (1870)

When the family decided to leave Russia for Europe, they needed a physician for two reasons:

1. **Romanoff's illness**: Marie's uncle-by-marriage Romanoff required medical supervision after his mental breakdown
2. **Maman's health**: Marie's mother "liked to make herself ill and was sometimes truly ill"

### Financial Arrangement

Marie notes with evident regret:

> "On emmena Walitsky en lui promettant des appointements selon l'usage en pareil cas. Je crois bien qu'il n'en reçut jamais presque rien, trop délicat pour demander et se contentant de quelques sous par ci par là pour payer son tailleur chez lequel il devait quelques centaines de francs en mourant."

("They took Walitsky along promising him salary according to usage in such cases. I believe he never received almost anything, too delicate to ask and contenting himself with a few coins here and there to pay his tailor to whom he owed a few hundred francs when he died.")

This passage reveals:
- **Economic exploitation**: Family promised but never properly paid him
- **Noble character**: Too proud/delicate to demand payment
- **Financial struggle**: Died with unpaid tailor bills of "quelques centaines de francs"
- **Devoted service**: Continued with family despite non-payment
- **Marie's awareness**: She understood the injustice even in 1873-74

## Roles in the Family

### Medical Duties
- Treated Romanoff's mental illness ("accès de délire et de folie")
- Attended to Maman's real and imagined illnesses
- General family physician during European travels

### Social Companion
- Traveled with family: Baden-Baden (June 1870), Nice (1873-74)
- Participated in family social activities
- Part of the household: "de tous temps de la maison"

### Intermediary (1873 Nice Period)
- Had social connections with Duke of Hamilton
- Promised to bring Hamilton to visit
- Made jokes and grimaces about Hamilton, noticing Marie's reactions
- Involved in household management (Palajka servant dispute)

## Character Assessment

Marie's tribute in Book 00 is extraordinarily warm:

- **"Angélique et incomparable"** (angelic and incomparable)
- **"Homme admirable"** (admirable man)
- **"Second soi-même"** (second self) for each family member
- **"Culte fraternel, admirable et saint"** (fraternal, admirable and holy devotion)

This stands in stark contrast to her harsh judgments of most people, marking Walitsky as someone she genuinely loved and respected.

## Timeline

- **University years**: Studied medicine with Marie's maternal uncles
- **1860s**: District physician at Akhtyrka, visiting family estates 3-4 times yearly

## Historical Context

The position of **district physician** (медицин округа) in 1860s-70s Russia:
- Government-appointed position
- Responsible for medical care across entire rural district
- Required university medical education
- Low pay, heavy workload, high prestige
- Often sole qualified doctor for large area

Walitsky abandoned this secure government position to follow the Bashkirtseff family to Europe, accepting vague promises of payment that were never fulfilled. This speaks to the depth of his attachment to the family, particularly to Marie's mother.
