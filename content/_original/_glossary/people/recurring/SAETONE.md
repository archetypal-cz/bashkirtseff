It seems permissions need to be granted for glossary edits. Could you approve the write permission? I'm trying to:

1. **Update** `content/_original/_glossary/people/recurring/SAETONE.md` with the merged content
2. **Delete** `content/_original/_glossary/society/clubs/SAETONE.md` (the duplicate)

The merged entry combines:
- **From target**: Full identity (Andriot, first name, code names), detailed 1875 Audiffret affair role, specific diary references for carnets 045-046
- **From source**: 16 mentions in 1873-1874, Italian heritage context, Nice's cultural background, social position details
- **Eliminated**: Speculative "Questions for Further Research" section (all answered by the target), redundant generic social analysis
- **Both RSR comments preserved**, plus a new merge comment
