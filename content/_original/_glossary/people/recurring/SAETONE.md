# Saetone (Andriot)

## Overview

Andriot Saetone is a Niçois man who acts as intermediary and go-between in Marie's social circle, particularly in matters involving Audiffret. Marie gives him multiple code names: "Mercure" (Mercury, messenger of the gods), "Enoteas" (anagram/wordplay on Saetone), and "Satan-Saetone" (combining his name with the devil). She also calls him "le Grand Mercure" (the chief messenger).

## Identity

- First name: Andriot (revealed in 046.0649: "Andriot Saëtone")
- Niçois social figure
- Older than Marie's circle; she ironically calls him "mon oncle"
- Described as handsome: "le bel Andriot" (046.0657)
- Associated with de Cessole in Audiffret's social group

## Role in Marie's Circle (1875)

Saetone occupies a specific and problematic role:
- **Entremetteur**: Nina Sapogenikoff identifies him as a meddler who deliberately stirs romantic intrigue among the young women
- **Audiffret's agent**: He carries messages, reports on sentiments, and tries to arrange connections between Audiffret and various girls (Marie, Olga)
- **Provocateur**: He told Olga that Audiffret was "éperdument amoureux d'elle" and mentioned her constantly in his letters — Nina sees this as deliberately "troubling" her daughter
- **Confidant**: Saetone positioned himself as confidant to everyone, which Marie mocks: "lorsqu'on est réduit à ce rôle, c'est le dernier mal d'un monsieur"
- **The insult incident**: Marie inadvertently snubbed Saetone by turning away when he offered his arm, causing a minor social crisis that runs through several entries

%% 2026-02-09T21:00:00 RSR: Created entry. Saetone is the social catalyst/meddler in the Audiffret affair. His first name Andriot is confirmed in carnet 046. Nina Sapogenikoff's denunciation of him as "entremetteur" (046.0378) is the key passage for understanding his function. %%
