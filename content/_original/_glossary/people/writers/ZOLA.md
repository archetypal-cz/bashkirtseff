## Basic Information

%% GLO_ZOLA.0002 %%
Emile Edouard Charles Antoine Zola (2 April 1840 -- 29 September 1902) was a French novelist, journalist, and public intellectual. He was the leading figure of the Naturalist literary movement and author of the monumental *Les Rougon-Macquart* cycle of 20 novels (1871-1893), which depicted life under the Second Empire through the story of one family.

## Historical Context During Marie's Lifetime

%% GLO_ZOLA.0004 %%
During the period of Marie's diary (1873-1884), Zola was establishing himself as the foremost novelist in France:
- **1877**: *L'Assommoir* (The Drinking Den) brought him fame and wealth
- **1880**: *Nana*, depicting the demi-monde, was a bestselling sensation
- **1882**: *Pot-Bouille*, a satire of bourgeois life
- **1883**: *Au Bonheur des Dames* (The Ladies' Paradise)
- **Literary doctrine**: His manifesto *Le Roman experimental* (1880) defined Naturalism as applying scientific method to fiction
- **Art criticism**: Before becoming a novelist, Zola was an influential art critic who championed the Impressionists, particularly Edouard Manet

## Connection to Marie

%% GLO_ZOLA.0006 %%
Marie mentions Zola as part of the contemporary cultural scene she followed closely. As someone who aspired to artistic recognition and moved in the same Parisian circles, Marie would have been acutely aware of Zola's work. His naturalist aesthetic -- depicting reality unflinchingly, including the lives of the poor and the demimonde -- paralleled the naturalist painting movement that influenced Marie's own art (through Bastien-Lepage and others).

%% GLO_ZOLA.0007 %%
Zola's depiction of women's lives, particularly in *Nana* (a courtesan) and *Au Bonheur des Dames* (working women), would have been particularly resonant for Marie, who was intensely aware of women's constrained position in society.
