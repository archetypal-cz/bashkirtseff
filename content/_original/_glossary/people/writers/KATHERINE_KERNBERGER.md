## Historical Context

%% GLO_KATHERINE_KERNBERGER.0010 %%
Before Kernberger's edition, the only English translation of Marie's diary was Mathilde Blind's heavily abridged 1890 version (*The Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff*), which omitted large portions and softened many passages. Kernberger's work represented a major scholarly advance by providing access to the full, uncensored text for English-language readers.
