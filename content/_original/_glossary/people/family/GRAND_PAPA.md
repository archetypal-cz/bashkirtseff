All diary entry references already point to the correct path `people/family/GRAND_PAPA.md`. The only reference to `places/theaters/GRAND_PAPA.md` is in `dedup-plan.yaml` which is presumably the dedup plan itself.

The two entries are identical — no merge needed. The TARGET at `people/family/GRAND_PAPA.md` is complete and all references already point to it. The SOURCE at `places/theaters/GRAND_PAPA.md` is a misplaced duplicate that should simply be deleted.

Should I delete `content/_original/_glossary/places/theaters/GRAND_PAPA.md`?
