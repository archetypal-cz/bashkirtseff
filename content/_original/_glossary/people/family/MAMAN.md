# Maman (Maria Stepanovna Babanina)

%% GLO_MAMAN.0002 %%
## Basic Information

Maria Stepanovna Babanina (1833-1920) was Marie Bashkirtseff's mother and a significant influence in her life. She came from the Russian *petite noblesse* (lesser nobility) and was proud of her Tatar ancestry.

## Family Background

Maria Stepanovna married Konstantin Bashkirtseff, but the couple separated in 1862 when Marie was still a young child. Following the separation, Maria took primary responsibility for raising Marie and managing the family affairs.

## Role in Marie's Life

In 1870, Maria Stepanovna left Russia with young Marie and traveled extensively across Europe before eventually settling in Nice, France, and later Paris. She was deeply involved in managing the family's affairs and was instrumental in supporting Marie's artistic ambitions.

Maria tailored the family's lifestyle and relocations to accommodate Marie's fragile health and career aspirations. Her decisions about where the family would live and how they would participate in society significantly shaped Marie's experiences and opportunities.

## Appearances in the Diary

In Marie's diary, "Maman" (the French word for mother) appears frequently. Marie often mentions her mother's activities, such as attending social events, musical performances, and making social calls. The January 18, 1873 entry notes that "Maman a dansé" (Mother danced) at the Cercle Masséna, indicating her active participation in Nice's social scene.

The January 30, 1873 entry mentions "Maman et Dina sont à une matinée musicale à l'hôtel Chauvain, au profit d'un pauvre Russe" (Mother and Dina are at a musical matinee at the Chauvain hotel, for the benefit of a poor Russian), showing Maria's continued connection to Russian cultural events even while living abroad.

## Historical Context

Maria Stepanovna's decision to leave Russia and settle in Western Europe was part of a broader pattern among the Russian aristocracy in the late 19th century. Many noble Russian families spent significant time in resort cities like Nice, creating expatriate communities that maintained Russian customs while adopting aspects of Western European lifestyles.

As a separated woman managing her family's affairs independently, Maria Stepanovna navigated the complex social expectations of her time. Her ability to establish her family in the competitive social circles of Nice and Paris demonstrated both her social skills and determination.

## Later Life

Maria Stepanovna outlived her daughter, who died of tuberculosis in 1884 at the age of 25. After Marie's death, Maria continued to support the preservation of her daughter's legacy, helping to ensure that Marie's artwork and diary were recognized for their artistic and historical significance.
