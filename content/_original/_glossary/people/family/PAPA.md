**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-30
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1874-01-01

## Overview

Marie's father, Constantin Bashkirtseff (sometimes written as Bashkirtseff), appears in her diary as "papa." He was a Russian nobleman and landowner from the Poltava region of Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire).

## Background

From Marie's diary entries and historical context:
- **Russian Nobleman**: Part of the landed gentry class
- **Landowner**: Owned estates in the Poltava region
- **Separated from Family**: By 1873, he was living separately from Marie and her mother

## Business Interests

The diary reveals several of his business activities:
- **Tobacco Production**: At the 1873 Vienna World Exhibition, his tobacco was displayed (secretly arranged by someone named Sacha as a surprise). Marie writes on August 13, 1873: "En Russie nous trouvâmes le tabac de papa. *Sacha* lui a fait une surprise en exposant."
- **Wine Interests**: Associated with Lefèvre wines, also displayed at the Vienna Exhibition

## Relationship with Marie

The diary entries from 1873-1874 suggest:
- **Limited Contact**: Marie rarely sees her father during this period
- **Complex Family Dynamics**: References to "amour-propre" (pride/self-respect) and various conflicts
- **Emotional Distance**: Marie's mentions of him are often matter-of-fact rather than affectionate

## Marriage History

A revealing entry from September 1, 1873, recounts a story about his marriage:
- Marie Ivanovna Perlik warned Marie's mother against marrying Bashkirtseff
- The warning went unheeded, suggesting later regrets
- This story implies a troubled marriage that may explain the family's separation

## Character Traits

Based on diary references:
- **Pride**: Described as having significant "amour-propre"
- **Business-minded**: Involved in various commercial enterprises
- **Socially Connected**: Part of Russian expatriate society

## Historical Context

Russian noble families of this period often had complex arrangements, with family members living in different countries for education, health, or social reasons. The Bashkirtseff family's separation and European travels were not uncommon among their social class.

## Questions for Further Research

- What led to the separation between Constantin and his family?
- What was the extent of his estates in Poltava?
- How successful were his business ventures?
- When and how did he die? (Marie's later diary entries may reveal this)

%% 2026-02-11T14:10:00 RSR: Per Kernberger (2013), Constantine Bashkirtseff (1833-1883) died at Gavronzi on June 11, 1883. He arrived in Paris in December 1878, and Marie learned from him that she was a full-term baby (contradicting the family's claim of premature birth). He returned to Russia in 1877 after visiting Nice. In 1881, he came to Paris wanting to take Marie back to Gavronzi, but she refused. He did not understand or approve Marie's dedication to painting.
