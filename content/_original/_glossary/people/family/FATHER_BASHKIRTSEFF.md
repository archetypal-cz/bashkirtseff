# Constantine Bashkirtseff (Marie's Father)

## Basic Information

Constantine Bashkirtseff (1833-1883) was Marie Bashkirtseff's father, a Russian nobleman and landowner from the Poltava region of Ukraine. Marie refers to him as "Papa" in her diary. He separated from Marie's mother in 1861.

## Family Background

- Son of General Paul Grigorievitch Bashkirtseff
- Landowner at Gavronzi estate near Poltava, Ukraine
- Married Marie Stepanovna Babanina
- Father of Marie (1858-1884) and Paul (1859-1899)

## Relationship with Marie

Constantine was largely absent from Marie's life after the parents' separation in 1861. Marie's mother took the children to Tcherniakovka (her family's estate), and later to Europe in 1870. Key events:
- In 1876, Marie visited her father in Ukraine, intending to bring him back to Rome to establish family respectability
- In November 1876, Marie and her father traveled to Paris together; she introduced him to Cassagnac
- They traveled to Rome at Christmas 1876, but he left before New Year without improving Marie's social standing
- In April 1881, he arrived in Paris wanting to take Marie back to Gavronzi, but she refused
- He did not understand or approve Marie's dedication to painting
- In 1882, the parents were somewhat reconciled after twenty years of separation
- He grew very ill in 1883; Marie's mother returned to Ukraine
- He died at Gavronzi on June 11, 1883

## Death

Marie reflected upon the often troubled relations between them and regretted not having traveled to Russia with her mother when her father was dying.
