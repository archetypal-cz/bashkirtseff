I need your permission to write to the glossary files. Could you approve the write permission? 

In the meantime, here's the summary of what I'm doing:

1. **The two entries are nearly identical** — same content, same RSR comment, same timestamp
2. **Only difference**: the SOURCE (`society/clubs/` — miscategorized!) preserves proper French diacriticals (élégante, fête, vénérée, où, très, mariés), while the TARGET (`people/family/`) has them stripped to ASCII
3. **No references** point to the `society/clubs/` path — only `people/family/` is referenced (from `000/000-04.md` in both original and Czech)

**Actions needed:**
- Update `people/family/VASSILISSA_BABANINE.md` — restore diacriticals, update date to 2026-02-10, add merge RSR comment
- Delete `society/clubs/VASSILISSA_BABANINE.md` — the miscategorized duplicate
