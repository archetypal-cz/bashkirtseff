## Overview

**Marie Bashkirtseff** (Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva; 24 November 1858 – 31 October 1884) was the author of the diary we are translating. Ukrainian-born painter, sculptor, diarist, and proto-feminist who lived and worked in Paris. Died of tuberculosis at age 25.

Born near [Poltava](Poltava.md) in the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) to a noble family. Her father Konstantin Pavlovich Bashkirtsev was a local marshal of nobility.

## Why She Matters

### Literary Pioneer

Her diary was **the second diary by a woman published in France** (1887). British Prime Minister **William Gladstone** called it "a book without a parallel."

She created the modern confessional diary genre—directly inspiring:
- **Anaïs Nin** (began her famous diary because of Marie)
- **Katherine Mansfield** (cited Marie as a model)
- **Simone de Beauvoir** (used the diary as a major source for *The Second Sex*)

### Feminist Icon

Wrote for Hubertine Auclert's feminist newspaper *La Citoyenne* (1881) under pseudonym "Pauline Orrel."

Her famous lament captures the frustration of 19th-century women:
> **"I know that I should become somebody; but with skirts—what can one do?"**

Feminist art historians Roszika Parker and Griselda Pollock wrote: "Never before had a woman so urgently proclaimed her ambition to excel, her hunger for public fame."

### Artist

Trained at the [Académie Julian](Academie_Julian.md) under [Tony Robert-Fleury](Tony_Robert_Fleury.md). Her masterpiece ***The Meeting*** (1884) hangs at the **Musée d'Orsay**—a naturalist street scene of working-class Parisian children.

She consciously took naturalism to urban settings, writing: "I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien."

Ranks **5th among Ukrainian painters** (after Malevich, Repin, Aivazovsky, Delaunay). Many works destroyed by Nazis in WWII; ~60 survive.

## The Censorship Problem

The 1887 diary was **heavily censored** by her mother—radical opinions removed, family scandals excised. Katherine Kernberger spent decades restoring the original from manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, published as:
- *I Am the Most Interesting Book of All* (Vol. 1, 1997)
- *Lust for Glory* (Vol. 2, 2013)

The original manuscript comprised **20,000 hand-written pages**.

## Cultural Legacy

- **Tomb at Passy Cemetery**: Full-sized artist studio replica, declared a **French historic monument**
- **Marie Bashkirtseff room** at Musée des Beaux Arts, Nice
- **Street named after her** in Nice
- **Bashkirtseff Prize** at Académie Julian
- Pilgrims visiting her grave since at least 1892

%% 2026-02-11T13:55:00 RSR: Per Kernberger (2013), Marie was born on November 12, 1858 (not November 24 as some sources state). The family celebrated her birthday on January 12, claiming she had been born prematurely — part of a long-continued subterfuge to conceal that she was a full-term baby born seven months after her parents' marriage. The false date "1860" was engraved on her tomb. She learned the truth from her father in 1878. %%
