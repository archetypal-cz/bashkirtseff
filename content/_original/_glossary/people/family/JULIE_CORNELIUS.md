## Identity

Marie's maternal grandmother. Born Julie Cornelius (also spelled Cornelius), married Marie's grandfather (the Byronic poet and military officer) at age 15.

## Life

**Marriage:**
- Married at 15 years old to Marie's grandfather
- Described as "tres douce et jolie" (very sweet and pretty) as a young woman
- Had nine children ("excusez du peu" - pardon the expression/quite a lot)

**Transformation:**
- Became "enorme et criarde en vieillissant" (enormous and shrill with age)
- "Absolument sacrifiee, ecrasee par la superiorite de son mari" (absolutely sacrificed, crushed by her husband's superiority)
- Her husband was "un joli despote et qui s'en vantait" (a pretty despot who boasted about it)

**Character:**
- Originally sweet and gentle
- Crushed by her domineering husband's personality
- Her loud, shrill behavior in old age perhaps a response to years of domination
- Marie's description is sympathetic - she sees her grandmother as a victim

## Historical Context

Julie Cornelius's life exemplifies the situation of many 19th-century Russian noblewomen:
- Married very young (15) to older, established men
- Expected to bear many children (Julie had nine)
- No recourse against despotic husbands
- Even cultured, "Byronic" men could be domestic tyrants
- Physical and personality changes reflecting years of submission
- The "sweet girl" transformed into something harder by life's pressures

## Family Name

The name Cornelius (Cornelius in French spelling) suggests possible German or Western European ancestry, common in Russian noble families who often had international connections.

## Marie's Perspective

Marie's description is notable for its psychological insight:
- She sees the cause-and-effect: sweet young girl -> crushed wife -> shrill old woman
- She understands her grandmother was "sacrificed" to male dominance
- She notes the husband's pride in his despotism
- This awareness of women's oppression likely influenced Marie's own fierce independence
- Marie refuses to repeat her grandmother's fate
