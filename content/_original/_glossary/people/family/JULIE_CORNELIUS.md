It seems file write permissions haven't been granted yet. Could you approve the write permission so I can update the target file? 

To summarize what I'm doing:
- **Target** (`people/family/JULIE_CORNELIUS.md`): Updating with proper French diacritics (très, énorme, sacrifiée, écrasée, supériorité, Cornélius, →) and setting `Last Updated` to 2026-02-10
- **Source** (`culture/literature/JULIE_CORNELIUS.md`): Will delete after — no diary entries reference this path
- The content is otherwise identical between both files, so no information is lost
