## Basic Information

%% GLO_LORD_LOFTUS.0002 %%
Lord Loftus was a British nobleman encountered by Marie in Nice during the social seasons. The Loftus family held the title Marquess of Ely (Irish peerage); the specific individual Marie references may be Augustus Loftus, 1st Baron Loftus (1817-1904), a British diplomat, or a member of his family.

## Connection to Marie's Diary

%% GLO_LORD_LOFTUS.0004 %%
In her Audiffret entries (carnet 047, October 1875), Marie mentions that "Bibi" was "originally Lord Loftus's nickname," which she then applied universally to various people in her circle, including Audiffret himself ("Bibi-Girofla"). This suggests Lord Loftus was a familiar figure in Marie's Nice social world before Audiffret's prominence.
