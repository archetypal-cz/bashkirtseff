## Connection to Marie's Diary

%% GLO_PRINCE_CHARLES_III.0004 %%
As the sovereign of Monaco during the period Marie frequented Nice and Monte Carlo (1873-1884), Prince Charles III was the ultimate authority in the tiny principality that featured so prominently in Marie's social world. The pigeon shooting competitions, casino events, and theater performances Marie attended at Monte Carlo all took place under his reign. Monte Carlo itself was named after him ("Mount Charles").
