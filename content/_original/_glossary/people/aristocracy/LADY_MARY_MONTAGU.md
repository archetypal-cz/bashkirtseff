## Significance in Marie's Diary

%% GLO_LADY_MARY_MONTAGU.0004 %%
Lady Mary Montagu's marriage to the Duke of Hamilton in December 1873 is of profound significance to Marie's diary. Throughout early 1873, Marie nursed an obsessive romantic fantasy about the Duke, observing him from afar in Nice and constructing elaborate plans to attract his attention. The Duke's engagement and marriage to Lady Mary -- a genuine aristocrat from one of England's premier noble families -- represented the reality that Marie could never compete for the Duke's affections.

In the Ostende entries of August 1874, Marie hears reports that the Duke's wife "is not at all pretty, but she is very wild" and "as mad as he is" -- descriptions that may reflect either reality or Marie's need to diminish her rival.
