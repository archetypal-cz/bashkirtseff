## Significance

%% GLO_DUCHESS_OF_EDINBURGH.0004 %%
As a Russian grand duchess who married into the British royal family, Maria Alexandrovna would have been a figure of great interest to the Russian expatriate community in Nice that included the Bashkirtseffs. Her marriage in January 1874 -- during the period of Marie's diary -- was a major social event uniting the Russian and British royal families. She later became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1893) when her husband inherited that duchy.
