An exhibition in Lyon mentioned by Markevitch on May 2, 1873. She tells Marie that it featured "splendid things: landaus etc." 

This reference triggers Marie's imagination - she writes about how she would be "inflamed" at the sight of such luxury items, wanting to buy everything, to be known there, and to order custom items.

Lyon was an important commercial and industrial center in France, regularly hosting trade exhibitions showcasing luxury goods, textiles (for which Lyon was famous), and carriages.
