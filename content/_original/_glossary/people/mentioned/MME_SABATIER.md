A society hostess in Nice who hosted a ball during the carnival season of February 1873.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 23, 1873**: Barnola visits the Bashkirtseff residence and recounts details from Mme Sabatier's ball, including that Boreel attended dressed as a bandit.

## Historical Context

Hosting balls during the Nice winter season was an important mark of social standing. These events required:
- A residence large enough to accommodate dancing and entertainment
- Sufficient wealth to provide refreshments and music
- Social connections to ensure good attendance
- Proper servants and organization

That Mme Sabatier's ball was attended by people like Boreel and discussed among Marie's social circle indicates she was a significant figure in Nice society during this period.
