A person mentioned in conversation during Marie's visit to the [#Howards](Howard_family.md) on March 4, 1874. The discussion about Vassilissa Egorovna appears to have been connected to comments about [#Bête](Bete.md).

## Context in Diary

Marie notes that at the Howards, there was conversation about Vassilissa Egorovna, though she doesn't provide details about who this person was or the nature of the discussion.

## Research Notes

The name suggests Russian origins - "Vassilissa" is a Russian feminine name, and "Egorovna" is a patronymic meaning "daughter of Egor." Given the Russian émigré circles in Nice during this period, she was likely part of the Russian community.

Further research needed to identify this person more specifically and understand her connection to the Howard family social circle.
