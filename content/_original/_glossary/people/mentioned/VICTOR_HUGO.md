## Connection to Marie

%% GLO_VICTOR_HUGO.0006 %%
Marie references Hugo as part of the literary and cultural landscape of her time. As an intellectually ambitious young woman who read voraciously and aspired to fame, Hugo represented the pinnacle of French cultural achievement. His political engagement (republicanism) would have intersected with Marie's own evolving political views, though her Bonapartist sympathies (through Cassagnac) complicated this.
