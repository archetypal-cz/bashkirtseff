## Basic Information

%% GLO_BETE.0002 %%
"Bete" (French: "beast" or "stupid one") is a nickname Marie uses in her diary for a female family member or close household companion who lived with the family in Nice during 1873-1874. The nickname is characteristically blunt and affectionate in the way Marie often assigned unflattering monikers to people around her.

## Identity

%% GLO_BETE.0004 %%
Bete's exact identity is not explicitly stated in the diary, but several clues emerge from context:
- **Shares a name day with "ma tante"**: The September 29, 1873 entry states "C'est la fete de ma tante, de Bete, de sa fille et de la petite Vera Anitchkoff," indicating that Bete, Ma tante, and Vera Anitchkoff all share the same saint's day celebration. The name day of September 29 is the feast of the Archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael), but in the Russian/Orthodox calendar this could correspond to different saints.
- **Has a daughter**: "sa fille" (her daughter) is mentioned alongside Bete
- **Female**: Referred to with feminine grammar and described shopping, attending social events
- **Part of the inner circle**: Lives with the family, accompanies Marie on outings, discusses the Duke of Hamilton and Gioia
- **Not a servant**: Treated as a social equal who goes on carriage rides and shopping expeditions with Marie

## Role in the Diary

%% GLO_BETE.0006 %%
Bete functions as one of Marie's daily companions during the Nice period (1873-1874):
- **Confidante about the Duke**: "Bete et Dina me proposerent le duc" (Sept 27, 1873) -- Bete and Dina brought up the Duke of Hamilton
- **Walking companion**: Marie goes into town with Bete ("Je vais en ville avec Bete")
- **Observer of Hamilton**: Bete comments on Gioia's resemblance to Marie: "Vous etes dans son genre, mais mieux, me dit Bete" (You are of her type, but better)
- **Prankster**: On Oct 4, 1873, Bete tricks Marie with a fabricated story about Gioia giving money to their coachman Auguste
- **Gossip partner**: "Nous avons parle avec Bete seulement de Gioia et de Hamilton" (Sept 28, 1873)
