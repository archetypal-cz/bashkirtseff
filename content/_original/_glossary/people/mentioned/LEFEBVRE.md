As an instructor at the Academie Julian, Lefebvre evaluated student work, judged competitions, and provided critiques. Marie would have encountered him regularly from 1877 onward as part of her art education.

%% GLO_LEFEBVRE.0007 %%
### 2. Lefevre -- Family Acquaintance in Nice (1873)

%% GLO_LEFEBVRE.0008 %%
A different "Lefevre" (without the 'b') appears in the Nice period: a dinner guest at the Bashkirtseff home on May 3, 1873, for Marie's mother's name day celebration, listed among guests along with the Anitchkoffs and Patton. This is likely a local acquaintance unrelated to the Paris art world.
