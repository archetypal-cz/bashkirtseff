## Overview

The Gavini family were important social connections for Marie Bashkirtseff in Paris during 1879. They represent Marie's efforts to establish herself in Parisian high society through strategic friendships.

## Family Members

### Monsieur Gavini
A well-connected Parisian gentleman who served as Marie's social guide and advisor. He provided her with:
- **Social intelligence**: Information about who was who in Parisian society
- **Strategic advice**: How to navigate social hierarchies
- **Introductions**: Access to influential circles
- **Protection**: Guidance on maintaining her reputation

### Madame Gavini
M. Gavini's wife, who was more cautious about Marie's behavior:
- Sometimes disapproved of Marie's associations (e.g., with Blanc)
- Concerned about propriety and Marie's reputation
- Part of the social network Marie cultivated

## Significance in Marie's Life

### Social Strategy
Marie writes candidly about her relationship with the Gavinis:
> "Quel idiot [Cassagnac]. Avec moi il serait devenu tout au monde... Songez-donc, toute seule j'ai trouvé les Gavini et je m'en trouve peu à peu d'autres"
> (What an idiot. With me he would have become everything... Just think, all alone I found the Gavinis and I'm gradually finding others)

This reveals Marie's conscious social networking strategy.

### Role in Marie's Development
The Gavinis provided:
- **Entry into society**: Bridge from outsider to insider
- **Social education**: Teaching her the unwritten rules
- **Network expansion**: Introducing her to other influential people
- **Reality checks**: M. Gavini's frank assessments of people's social standing

### Example: Social Guidance
M. Gavini explained to Marie that Blanc was not a true gentleman but "de troisième catégorie" (third category), helping her understand subtle social distinctions.

## Historical Context

The Gavinis represent the type of established Parisian family that newcomers like the Bashkirtseffs needed to cultivate for social acceptance. Despite Marie's wealth and beauty, she needed such connections to navigate the complex hierarchy of Third Republic Paris.
