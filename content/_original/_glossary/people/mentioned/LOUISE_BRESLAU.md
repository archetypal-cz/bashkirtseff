## Basic Information

%% GLO_LOUISE_BRESLAU.0002 %%
Louise Catherine Breslau (6 December 1856, Munich -- 12 May 1927, Neuilly-sur-Seine) was a Swiss painter of German birth, known primarily for her portraits, still lifes, and interior scenes. She was Marie Bashkirtseff's chief rival at the Academie Julian and one of the most talented women artists of the late 19th century.

## Early Life and Education

%% GLO_LOUISE_BRESLAU.0004 %%
Born in Munich to a German-Jewish father (a professor of classical philology) and a Swiss mother, Breslau grew up in Zurich after her father's death when she was young. She was educated at a convent and took her first drawing lessons from Swiss portraitist Eduard Pfyffer (1874-1876). She then enrolled at the Academie Julian in Paris, choosing it because the Ecole des Beaux-Arts was still closed to women.
