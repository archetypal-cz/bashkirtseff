## Basic Information

%% GLO_RODOLPHE_JULIAN.0002 %%
Pierre Louis Rodolphe Julian (13 June 1839, Lapalud, Vaucluse -- 2 February 1907, Paris) was a French painter, etcher, and art professor, founder and director of the Academie Julian in Paris. He was one of the most important figures in Marie Bashkirtseff's artistic life, as the director of the art school where she studied from 1877 until her death in 1884.

## Early Career

%% GLO_RODOLPHE_JULIAN.0004 %%
Julian came from modest origins in southeastern France. He studied painting in Paris and exhibited at the Salon, but achieved only moderate success as a painter. His true vocation proved to be as an art educator and impresario. In 1868, he founded the Academie Julian at the Passage des Panoramas in Paris as a private studio school for art students.

## The Academie Julian

%% GLO_RODOLPHE_JULIAN.0006 %%
The Academie Julian became one of the most important private art schools in Paris. Its significance lay in several innovations:
- **Open to women**: Unlike the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, which did not admit women until 1897, Julian's school offered women full art instruction with live models from the beginning
- **Open to foreigners**: Students of all nationalities were welcomed, making it a truly international institution
- **No entrance exam**: Unlike the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, anyone could enroll by paying fees
- **Professional instruction**: Julian hired the most distinguished Salon artists as teachers, including William Bouguereau, Tony Robert-Fleury, Jules Lefebvre, Jean-Paul Laurens, and Gabriel Ferrier
- **Salon preparation**: Julian prepared his students specifically for the annual Salon competitions, and his school produced numerous medal winners

## Relationship with Marie Bashkirtseff

%% GLO_RODOLPHE_JULIAN.0008 %%
Marie enrolled at the Academie Julian in October 1877 and remained a student there for the rest of her life. Julian appears frequently in her diary as:
- **"Julian"**: The standard reference in the diary, used both for the man himself and metonymically for the school ("aller chez Julian" = going to the studio)
- **School director**: Managing the women's atelier, setting up model poses, organizing competitions
- **Encourager**: Julian recognized Marie's talent and supported her development
- **Social figure**: Present at evening sessions, interacting with students

%% GLO_RODOLPHE_JULIAN.0009 %%
Marie's diary captures the atmosphere of the school vividly: the cramped studios, the competition between students, the excitement of Salon submissions, and the camaraderie among the women students. Julian himself appears as a businesslike but supportive figure who took his role seriously.

## Historical Significance

%% GLO_RODOLPHE_JULIAN.0013 %%
The Academie Julian played a crucial role in the history of women's art education. At a time when women were excluded from the official French art academy, Julian provided professional-level training that enabled women to compete in the Salon and develop serious artistic careers. The school operated continuously from 1868 until 1968, training generations of artists from around the world.
