# Edmond

**Research Status**: Moderate  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-16  
**Diary Coverage**: 1877  

## Identity
Professional cartomancer (card reader/fortune teller) operating in Paris in September 1877. Distinguished himself among his peers as "l'homme sérieux parmi les siens" according to Marie's assessment.

## Background
Edmond claimed to have been exiled from France for making a politically sensitive prediction to Emperor Napoleon III. Given that Napoleon III was already in exile in England by 1870 and died in 1873, this prediction likely occurred earlier and concerned the Emperor's future troubles or downfall.

## Historical Context
Fortune-telling and cartomancy were popular in 1877 Paris despite legal restrictions under Article 479 of the criminal code. Professional cartomancers could face fines up to 15 francs and 5 days imprisonment if caught making a living from divination. The fact that Edmond refused payment from Marie suggests either caution about legal issues or genuine respect for her case.

## Marie's Encounters
- **September 26, 1877**: Marie visits Edmond, who finds her case so chaotic he cannot provide a reading and refuses payment
- **September 28, 1877**: Marie returns for a detailed reading where Edmond provides extensive predictions about her future

## Characteristics
- Described as serious and credible among fortune tellers
- Claimed political exile background
- Ethical enough to refuse payment when unable to provide service
- Provided detailed, psychologically perceptive readings

## Note
The extensive prediction Edmond gave Marie on September 28, 1877 demonstrated remarkable psychological insight and knowledge of her circumstances, suggesting either genuine intuitive ability or careful prior observation.
