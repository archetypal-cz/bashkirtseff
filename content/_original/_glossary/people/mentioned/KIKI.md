Kiki was a visitor to Marie's home in Paris in October 1880. On October 17, Kiki came with Saint-Amand while Marie and her aunt were at the Concert Pasdeloup. On October 25, they found Kiki waiting when they returned home.

By October 1880, Marie notes that "each visit is a subject of terror to me" due to her increasing deafness - she feared being unable to hear what visitors were saying.

The nickname "Kiki" suggests this was an intimate friend or family member, though Marie provides no further details about their identity.
