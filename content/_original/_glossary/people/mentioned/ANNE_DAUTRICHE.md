# Anne d'Autriche (Anne of Austria)

## Overview

Anne of Austria (1601-1666) was Queen of France as the wife of Louis XIII and regent for her son Louis XIV from 1643 to 1651. Born a Spanish princess (Infanta Ana Maria Mauricia), she governed France during the tumultuous period of the Fronde (1648-1653), a series of civil wars against royal authority.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie dreams about the Fronde on 1875-08-17, imagining herself entering the service of Anne d'Autriche and leading the queen through a mutinous crowd while crying "Vive la Reine." The dream reveals Marie's fascination with historical female power and her own desire for heroic agency. Marie had likely been reading Alexandre Dumas's novels about the Musketeers era, which prominently feature Anne d'Autriche.

## Historical Context

During the Fronde, Anne faced popular uprisings against the regency government and its chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin. The rebels forced her to dismiss Mazarin in 1651, but she ultimately prevailed, preserving royal authority for her son Louis XIV. The Fronde was the last major challenge to French monarchical power before the Revolution of 1789.
