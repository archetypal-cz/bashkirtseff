## Basic Information

Paul was Marie Bashkirtseff's younger brother, 14 years old in 1874, who lived with the family in Nice. He was close in age to Marie but severely neglected in his education and corrupted by bad influences.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Paul served multiple roles in Marie's daily life:
- **Shopping Companion**: Accompanied Marie on shopping expeditions, including purchasing gifts for feast days
- **Riding Companion**: Regular morning rides, though he sometimes refused out of spite
- **Family Mediator**: Sometimes took Marie's side in family disputes
- **Social Participant**: Attended dinners and social events with the family

His presence provided Marie with a peer companion, though she harshly criticized his degradation:
- Ignorant and barely literate ("sait à peine écrire et lire")
- Corrupted by servants, especially cook Adam
- Frequents cafés, theaters, and actresses
- Out until early morning hours
- Only studies 2 hours per day
- Mother powerless to control him

## Historical Context

In aristocratic Russian families, it was common for extended family members to live together or spend long periods visiting. Young male relatives often served as appropriate escorts for unmarried female family members, providing a respectable alternative to going out only with female chaperones.
