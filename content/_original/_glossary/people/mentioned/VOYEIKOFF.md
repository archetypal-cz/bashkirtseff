## Overview

Madame Voyeïkoff was a Russian acquaintance of the Bashkirtseff family, living in Paris with her children in August 1873. Marie had known the family previously and is disappointed by how much Madame Voyeïkoff has changed.

## Personal Description

Marie's observations about Madame Voyeïkoff in August 1873:
- Has gained weight ("elle a grossi")
- Has become ugly ("devenue laide")
- Extremely affected in manners ("maniérée à l'impossible")
- Completely changed from her former self
- No longer the pleasant "aimable Mme Voyeïkoff" she once was
- Now "une affectée, laide, bête et sans manières" (affected, ugly, stupid and ill-mannered)

## Family

Madame Voyeïkoff has daughters, including:
- Julie: described as "la même vilaine" (still ugly)
- Other children who "n'ont pas grandi" (haven't grown)
- The daughters have been placed in an institute (boarding school)

Marie considers the children "de vilains enfants" (nasty children) and approves of their being sent to boarding school.

## Social Position

The Voyeïkoff family appears to be part of the Russian expatriate community in Paris:
- Living in Paris during the summer of 1873
- Maintains social connections with other Russian families
- The family diacre (deacon) is invited to lunch with them
- Aware of gossip about other Russian aristocrats

## August 1873 Visit

When the Bashkirtseffs visit in Paris:
- They call at the Voyeïkoff home
- The diacre (deacon) accompanying Marie's aunt is invited to lunch
- Marie has an uncomfortable conversation with Julie about education
- Marie firmly leaves as soon as polite to do so

### The Education Debate

Julie criticizes extensive study, especially Latin and Greek, as foolish for women. Marie argues that women should study as much as men and that knowing only how to chatter in French and discuss fashion is insufficient. The exchange reveals class and educational attitudes among Russian expatriate families.

## Marie's Attitude

Marie finds the visit tedious and is "vraiment contente" (truly happy) to leave. The changed Madame Voyeïkoff represents everything Marie dislikes: pretension without substance, affected manners, and intellectual shallowness.
