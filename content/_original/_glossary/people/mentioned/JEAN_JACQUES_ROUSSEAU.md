## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_JEAN_JACQUES_ROUSSEAU.0006 %%
Rousseau's *Confessions* is the most important literary precedent for Marie's own diary project. His commitment to radical self-honesty -- "I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent... I will present myself... before the Sovereign Judge" -- mirrors Marie's own famous opening: "If I should die young, I should like this diary to be published." Both writers understood their life writing as a form of self-exhibition before posterity.
