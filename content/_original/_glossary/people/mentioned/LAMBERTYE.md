## Basic Information

%% GLO_LAMBERTYE.0002 %%
The Comte de Lambertye was a French aristocrat who appears repeatedly in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary across multiple years and locations (Nice, Paris, Dieppe). The Lambertye family was a genuine French noble family from Lorraine, with the title of comte (count). However, the specific individual Marie references has not been conclusively identified from historical records.

## First Encounter: Nice (1873-1874)

%% GLO_LAMBERTYE.0004 %%
Lambertye first appears in December 1873, during the winter social season in Nice. He frequents the same locations as Marie's family:
- The Promenade des Anglais
- The Cercle de la Mediterranee
- Theaters and social events
- Monte Carlo

### February 1874 -- The Humiliation

%% GLO_LAMBERTYE.0006 %%
The most emotionally charged encounter occurs on February 12, 1874, when Marie nearly faints from embarrassment after thinking she sees Lambertye near the public garden. She is furious at his "impudent looks" and "impudent, impolite, coarse smile." Marie feels he stares boldly at her because he sees the family's diminished social position and does not bother seeking a proper formal introduction -- a grave breach of etiquette that she interprets as class contempt. She wishes to have him beaten.

## Later Appearances

%% GLO_LAMBERTYE.0008 %%
Despite this initial hostility, Lambertye continues to appear in Marie's diary across many years:
- **Nice 1873-1875**: Regular sightings during the winter social seasons (carnets 014, 020, 025, 038, 040)
- **Summer 1875**: Appears during the summer season, often near Audiffret
- **Dieppe 1879**: Resurfaces during Marie's Dieppe summer alongside Blanc and other acquaintances (carnet 086)
- **Paris 1882**: Still in Marie's orbit at social gatherings with Gavini and others (carnet 094)

%% GLO_LAMBERTYE.0009 %%
This span of nearly a decade across multiple cities suggests Lambertye was part of the same international social circuit as the Bashkirtseffs -- the world of wealthy Europeans who migrated between Nice in winter, Paris in spring, and resort towns in summer.

## Significance in Marie's Life

%% GLO_LAMBERTYE.0011 %%
Lambertye represents a recurring theme in Marie's diary: the anxiety of social position. His refusal to seek a formal introduction (despite apparent interest), his bold staring, and his reappearances across the years embody the social humiliation Marie felt about her family's ambiguous status. The Bashkirtseffs were wealthy but not firmly established in French aristocratic society, and encounters like these with genuine French nobility reminded Marie painfully of the gap.
