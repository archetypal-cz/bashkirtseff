# Mere Georges

## Overview

"La mere Georges" is the proprietress of a seaside bathing establishment in Nice. She has known both Marie Bashkirtseff and Emile d'Audiffret since they were small children, indicating she is a long-standing fixture of the Nice beachfront.

## Relevance to Marie

She plays an inadvertent matchmaking role, seating Marie and Audiffret next to each other at the baths and emphasizing that she has known them both since childhood. Her familiar manner ("M. Emile") contrasts with Marie's more formal social register.
