# Fiouloulou (Detriaz)

## Overview

A young Niçois man, aspiring notary, whose real surname is Detriaz. Marie refers to him by the nickname "Fiouloulou" (sometimes spelled "Fioulouiou"). He is a persistent but unwanted suitor who becomes Audiffret's loyal follower.

## Identity

- Full name includes surname **Detriaz** (revealed in carnet 045: "Fiouloulou-Detriaz")
- Dark-haired ("le noir Niçois")
- Training to become a notary ("le futur notaire")
- Marie earlier referred to him as "clerk" in English

## Role in Marie's Circle (1875)

By autumn 1875 (carnet 045), Fiouloulou occupies a specific social role:
- **Audiffret's "Figaro"**: Marie calls him Audiffret's servant/valet, comparing him to the famous Beaumarchais character
- **"Suivant-confident"**: Marie elevates him to the theatrical role of the attendant-confidant
- **The faithful one**: After Audiffret abandons Marie for Gioia, Fiouloulou is "le seul, le fidèle, l'insignifiant Fiouloulou" — the only one who still attends to Marie
- **Minor romantic interest**: He "dares to court" Marie, and she tolerates it out of boredom
- **Cinderella scene**: In a playful incident, Marie's slipper falls down the stairs and Fiouloulou retrieves it — "Cendrillon et le prince charmant!" she notes ironically
