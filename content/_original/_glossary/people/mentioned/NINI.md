## Overview

Nini is a family member or close household companion who appears in Marie's diary entries during the Paris period. She is characterized as overly protective and emotionally reactive regarding Marie's health.

## References in Diary

In Book 14, January 2, 1880 entry, Marie describes going out in a closed carriage with Dina and Nini to avoid harassment from "the old people." When Marie opens a carriage window, "Dina turns away to contain her indignation" while "Nini all in supplications and tears!"

This suggests Nini is particularly emotional and concerned about Marie's health and well-being, to the point of tears when Marie does something considered risky.
