## Identity

The Babanine (Babanin) family was Marie Bashkirtseff's maternal family line. Marie's mother was Maria Stepanovna Babanina, and the family claimed ancient Tatar nobility origins dating to the first Mongol invasion of Russia.

## Family Origin and Nobility Status

### Tatar Heritage

According to Marie's 1884 preface, the Babanine family was "de vieille noblesse de province" (old provincial nobility), and her grandfather proudly claimed Tatar ancestry from the first invasion: "Grand-papa s'est toujours vanté d'être d'origine tartare de la première invasion."

The family name itself reflects this heritage. According to the legend of the House of Babanin, during a war between the Mongols and the Tsardom of Russia, a high-ranked Mongolian warlord named Yin was captured and spared by the Tsar, who gave him a woman and royal standard. In old Russian, "baba" (Баба) means woman, so "Babanin" translates to "Yin's woman."

### Historical Context

Many Russian noble families traced their lineage to Tatar origins. After Vasily II, the number of Tatars entering the Muscovite nobility rose dramatically. A 17th-century compilation showed that 156 noble families were of Tatar or similar origin, and modern estimates suggest one-third of all Russian nobles were of Turkic origins.

The Babanine family originates from Avksentiev Trufanovich (1588-1620), who had two sons: Kir (Cyrus) and Ivan.

## Etymology

Marie notes in her diary: "Baba-Nina sont des mots tartares, moi je m'en moque" (Baba-Nina are Tatar words, I don't care about it). This reflects her pragmatic, rather than romantic, view of her ancient ancestry.

## Distribution

In modern times, the surname Babanin is most frequently found in Russia, particularly in Lipetsk Oblast (47%), Kursk Oblast (5%), and Moscow (5%).
