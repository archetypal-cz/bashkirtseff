## Basic Information

%% GLO_AMELIE_GIOIA.0002 %%
"Amelie Gioia" appears to be a reference combining two separate figures in Marie's diary. It is likely either:
1. **A variant reference to Gioia** -- the courtesan/demimondaine who was companion to the Duke of Hamilton and later to Audiffret. The main entry for Gioia is at [places/cities/GIOIA.md](../../places/cities/GIOIA.md), which contains comprehensive information. The first name "Amelie" may be Gioia's actual given name.
2. **A coincidental combination** of two common names in Marie's circle.

## Context

%% GLO_AMELIE_GIOIA.0004 %%
The fact that "Gioia" means "joy" or "jewel" in Italian suggests it was a sobriquet (nickname) rather than a family name, which is consistent with the customs of the demimonde. If "Amelie" is indeed Gioia's real first name, this would be valuable identifying information. Marie herself makes the connection between the name and the Italian word in her diary, calling Gioia "bijou de mon ame" (jewel of my soul) ironically.
