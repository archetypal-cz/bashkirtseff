A young woman Marie met at the Howard residence on February 28, 1873.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 28, 1873**: Marie visits the Howard family residence and makes the acquaintance of Mlle Betalli, whom she describes as "assez gentille" (quite nice).

## Historical Context

The Italian surname Betalli and the formal "Mlle" (Mademoiselle) suggest this was an unmarried young woman from an Italian family, likely part of the international aristocratic colony wintering in Nice. The fact that she was at the Howard residence suggests either:
- She was staying with the Howards
- She was visiting socially
- She was part of their social circle

Marie's brief assessment ("quite nice") is relatively positive, suggesting this was a pleasant first meeting that might have led to future social connections.
