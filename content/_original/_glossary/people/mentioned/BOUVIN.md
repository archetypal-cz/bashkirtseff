Bouvin was a contemporary artist known to Rodolphe Julian and Marie in 1880. When Julian critiqued Marie's painting from Mont-Dore in October 1880, he described it as "a mixture of Bastien-Lepage and Bouvin."

This suggests Bouvin was a recognized painter working in a modern or naturalist style, though less famous than Bastien-Lepage. Julian's comment implies Bouvin's work was known for certain technical or stylistic characteristics that he could identify in Marie's painting.

Further research needed to identify this artist more precisely among late 19th century French painters.
