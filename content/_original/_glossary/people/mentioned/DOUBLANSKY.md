# M. Doublansky

## Overview

A neighbor of the Bashkirtseff family in Ukraine (likely Poltava region) who was the previous victim of the Zankovsky family's predatory scheme before they targeted Paul Bashkirtseff.

## Relevance to Marie

Mentioned on 1875-08-17 as the Zankovskys' earlier mark: "Avant Paul, elles avaient un de nos voisins, un M. Doublansky." The implication is that the Zankovskys systematically target and fleece young men through gambling and seduction.
