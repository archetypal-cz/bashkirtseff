# Paul Bashkirtseff

## Overview

Marie's half-brother (or brother), son of Konstantin Bashkirtseff. Paul remained in Russia while Marie and her mother lived abroad in Western Europe.

## Relevance to Marie

In August 1875, news arrives from Russia that Paul is enlisting as a voluntary soldier, manipulated by the Zankovsky family. He has fallen in love with the younger Zankovsky daughter, "qui se conduit mal" (who behaves badly), and is joining a regiment to be near her brother. This news causes Maman great distress. Marie's uncle Alexandre attempts to intervene.

## Family Context

Paul's situation illustrates the divided Bashkirtseff family: Marie and her mother in Western Europe, Paul and the father's side in Ukraine/Russia. The family drama about Paul's military enlistment and the Zankovskys' influence is received only through letters.
