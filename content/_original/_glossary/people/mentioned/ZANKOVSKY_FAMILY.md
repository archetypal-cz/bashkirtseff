# Zankovsky Family

## Overview

A Ukrainian family involved in gambling and what Marie describes as predatory social behavior. The family includes a mother, a younger daughter, and a son ("le frere de la belle"). Marie portrays them as a corrupt clique who ensnare young men for financial exploitation.

## Members Mentioned

- **Mme Zankovsky (the mother)**: Described as "une personne tres depravee" who wins at cards constantly, implying she cheats.
- **Mlle Zankovsky (younger daughter)**: "se conduit mal" (behaves badly); procures young men for her mother to fleece at cards.
- **The son**: "un atroce garnement" (a terrible rogue); serves in a regiment that Paul Bashkirtseff joins to be near the sister.

## Relevance to Marie

The Zankovskys are the cause of family distress in August 1875. Paul Bashkirtseff (Marie's half-brother) has fallen for the younger daughter, and the family is pushing him to enlist as a soldier to be in the same regiment as the Zankovsky son. Their previous victim was a neighbor named Doublansky. The news arrives by letter from Russia, causing Maman to have one of her nervous crises.
