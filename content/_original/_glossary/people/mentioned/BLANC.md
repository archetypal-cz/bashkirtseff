## Basic Information

%% GLO_BLANC.0002 %%
"Blanc" in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary refers to two distinct individuals across different periods:

%% GLO_BLANC.0003 %%
### 1. Blanc of Nice (1873-1874)

%% GLO_BLANC.0004 %%
In the earliest diary entries (1873-1874), "Blanc" likely refers to Francois Blanc (1806-1877) or a member of his family. Francois Blanc was the legendary developer of the Monte Carlo Casino who transformed Monaco into a premier gambling destination. Known as "The Magician of Monte Carlo," he organized social events including hosting dinners for all pigeon shooters at the shooting grounds (January 23, 1874 entry). The Blanc family was at the center of the elite social scene in Nice and Monaco during this period.

%% GLO_BLANC.0005 %%
### 2. Blanc of Paris (1878-1879)

%% GLO_BLANC.0006 %%
In the later diary entries (1878-1879, carnets 080-086), "Blanc" refers to a man in Marie's Parisian social circle. This Blanc is:
- **A social acquaintance**: Encounters Marie at the Orangerie in the Bois de Boulogne and other social venues
- **A gossip source**: Provides information about Cassagnac and other figures in Parisian society
- **Socially ambiguous**: M. Gavini assessed Blanc as being "de troisieme categorie" (third category) -- meaning not a genuine gentleman but from a lower social stratum
- **Summer companion**: Appears with Marie in Dieppe during the summer of 1879, where they socialize frequently
- **Socially persistent**: Despite Mme Gavini's disapproval, Blanc remained part of Marie's social circle

%% GLO_BLANC.0007 %%
## Role in Marie's Social Life

%% GLO_BLANC.0008 %%
The Parisian Blanc serves as:
- **Social companion**: Accompanies Marie to parks, gatherings, and resort towns
- **Information broker**: Brings gossip about Paul de Cassagnac's marital scandals, political news, and society developments
- **Source of tension**: Mme Gavini disapproves of Marie's association with him, illustrating the careful social calculations Marie must navigate

%% GLO_BLANC.0009 %%
## Diary Coverage

%% GLO_BLANC.0010 %%
With 117 references, Blanc appears heavily concentrated in the period 1878-1879 (carnets 080-086), particularly during Marie's Dieppe summer of 1879 when he is mentioned almost daily. The frequency suggests he was a constant presence during this period of Marie's social life.

Distinguished between two "Blancs" in the diary: the Blanc of Nice (1873-1874, likely connected to Francois Blanc of Monte Carlo) and the Blanc of Paris (1878-1879), a social companion of lower standing whom Gavini called "de troisieme categorie." %%
