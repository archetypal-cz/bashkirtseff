**Diary Coverage**: August 1873

## Overview

Bikowsky was an acquaintance of the Bashkirtseff family, a small man whom Marie had not seen for some time before their chance encounter in Paris in August 1873.

## Personal Description

Marie describes him as:
- Very short ("petit, petit, petit")
- Grown a beard since she last saw him
- Previously looked like a 20-year-old boy, now looks like a 35-year-old man
- "Assez agréable" (rather agreeable)
- A "petit menteur quelquefois" (little liar sometimes)

## Social Connections

Bikowsky appears to be part of the Russian expatriate community in France:
- Knows many people from Nice
- Familiar with Casa Play
- Has met Comtesse de Galve at social events
- Can provide detailed descriptions of people's character and mannerisms

## August 1873 Encounter

The family encounters Bikowsky on the street in Paris near Mantel's hat shop on August 23:
- Marie's aunt recognizes him first
- He is delighted to meet them
- Invited to lunch at their hotel
- Accompanies them to the races at Porchefontaine on August 24
- Stays at the Grand Hotel briefly with the family

During the races, Bikowsky has the audacity to comment on the Duke of Hamilton's size ("grosseur"), which Marie finds inappropriate coming from someone so small himself.

## Marie's Attitude

Marie tolerates Bikowsky but doesn't particularly enjoy his company:
- She's glad when he leaves
- She gives him only "deux doigts" (two fingers) to shake when saying goodbye
- She finds his presence somewhat constrains her behavior
