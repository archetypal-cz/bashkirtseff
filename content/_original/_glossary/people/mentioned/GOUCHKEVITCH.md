## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 27, 1873**: Prince Gagarine told Marie's mother that after the ball at the Cercle Masséna, Gagarine, Boreel, Markoff, and Gouchkevitch had supper together until 6 AM. During this gathering, Boreel drank excessively, became ill, and made declarations about being Prussian (though he lived in Holland).

## Historical Context

The Russian surname "Gouchkevitch" (Гушкевич) places this person firmly in the Russian aristocratic colony that wintered in Nice. The all-night drinking party was typical of young aristocratic men's social activities - behavior that would not have been reported to ladies' families except through gossip channels like Prince Gagarine.

That Gouchkevitch was part of this group suggests he was:
- Of similar social standing to Boreel, Markoff, and Prince Gagarine
- Young enough to engage in these youthful excesses
- Part of the international male social circle in Nice

The incident reveals the parallel male social world that existed alongside the formal balls and promenades where men and women socialized under more controlled circumstances.
