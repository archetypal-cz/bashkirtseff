Léon Say (1826-1896), French statesman, economist, and politician. He served multiple terms as Minister of Finance in the Third Republic and was a prominent moderate republican.

## Historical Context
Say came from a distinguished family of economists (grandson of Jean-Baptiste Say). He served as Minister of Finance five times between 1872-1882, managing France's post-war economic recovery. A moderate republican, Say supported free trade and fiscal conservatism.

## Political Position
Say represented centrist republicanism - supporting the Republic while opposing both monarchist restoration and radical socialism. He was influential in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate.

## Diary References
- March 6, 1881: Marie mentions that Amélie arranged for Julian's Legion of Honor decoration through her relative Léon Say: "c'est elle qui l'a fait décorer par Léon Say son parent" (it's she who had him decorated by Léon Say, her relative)

## Significance
The connection reveals Amélie's family had powerful political connections at the highest levels of government. Using such influence to secure Julian's decoration would have been a significant favor, perhaps explaining Julian's favoritism toward Amélie despite Marie's artistic superiority.

## Marie's Reaction
Marie suspects Julian criticized her painting ("il lui manquera toujours une qualité... la qualité de peinture") to please Amélie and compensate for Tony Robert-Fleury's harsh critiques of Amélie's work. The Léon Say connection makes Julian politically indebted to Amélie's family.
