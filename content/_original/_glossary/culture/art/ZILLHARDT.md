Amélie Zillhardt was a fellow student at the Académie Julian in November 1880. She witnessed Marie crying under her monk's hood at the atelier and "was quite astonished," having come to see if Marie's display of emotion was genuine or a joke.

Marie refers to her somewhat dismissively as "cette Amélie" (that Amélie), suggesting they were not close friends despite being fellow students.

This incident reveals how Marie's distress over her artistic progress was visible even to casual acquaintances at the atelier.
