## Impact on Russia

The war's aftermath had profound effects on Russian society:
- Military modernization and restructuring
- Promotions for successful officers (like Paul Grigorievitch Bashkirtseff)
- Emancipation of serfs (1861) partly motivated by wartime weaknesses
- Economic strain leading to social reforms

## Connection to Bashkirtseff Family

Marie's paternal grandfather, General Paul Grigorievitch Bashkirtseff, was promoted to general rank after the Crimean War, suggesting he distinguished himself in the conflict. Like many military men of his generation, he used his accumulated wealth and status to purchase land after retiring from service.
