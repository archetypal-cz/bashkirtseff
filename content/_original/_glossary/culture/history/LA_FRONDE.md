# La Fronde

## Overview

The Fronde (1648-1653) was a series of French civil wars during the minority of Louis XIV, directed against the regency government of Anne d'Autriche and her chief minister Cardinal Mazarin. The name comes from the French word for "sling" (fronde), after the slings used by Parisian rioters to break windows.

## Two Phases

1. **Fronde parlementaire** (1648-1649): The Parlement of Paris resisted royal taxation and demanded constitutional reforms.
2. **Fronde des princes** (1650-1653): Aristocratic rebellion led by the Prince de Conde and others seeking personal power.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie dreams about the Fronde on 1875-08-17 at Schlangenbad, imagining herself serving Anne d'Autriche and rallying the crowd to cry "Vive la Reine." The dream reflects her fascination with French history, likely fueled by Alexandre Dumas's novels (especially the Musketeers trilogy, set in this period). Marie identifies with the queen's need for loyal servants and the drama of popular revolt.

## Historical Context

The Fronde was the last major rebellion against the French crown before the Revolution of 1789. It was widely romanticized in 19th-century French literature, particularly by Dumas, making it familiar material for a well-read 14-year-old like Marie.
