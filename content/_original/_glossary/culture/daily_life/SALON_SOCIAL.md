## Overview

%% GLO_SALON_SOCIAL.0002 %%
A salon was a regular social gathering hosted by a prominent woman (or occasionally a man) at their private residence, where invited guests conversed, discussed literature, art, politics, and current events. The French salon tradition, dating from the 17th century, was still thriving in Marie's era and served as the primary venue for intellectual and social networking in Parisian upper-class society.

## Marie's Experience

Marie attended salons throughout her Parisian life:
- **Mme de Brimont**: Thursday receptions attracting politicians and distinguished men
- **Various hostesses**: Marie judges salons by their quality of guests and conversation
- **Aspiration**: Marie's family maintains its own salon, and Marie is conscious of the quality of their guest list
- **Social intelligence**: Salons were where one learned news, made connections, and assessed one's social standing

## Significance

%% GLO_SALON_SOCIAL.0008 %%
The salon was the engine of Parisian social life and one of the few institutions where women exercised genuine cultural power. As hostess, a woman controlled access, set the intellectual tone, and could make or break reputations. For Marie, attending salons was both social obligation and intelligence-gathering — she studied the dynamics with the same analytical eye she brought to everything.
