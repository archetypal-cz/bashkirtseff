%% GLO_TOILETTE.0001 %%
## Overview

%% GLO_TOILETTE.0002 %%
In 19th-century French, "toilette" had two related meanings: (1) the process of dressing, grooming, and preparing one's appearance, and (2) the resulting outfit or ensemble. Marie uses both senses extensively. "Faire sa toilette" (to make one's toilette) was the elaborate morning ritual of bathing, dressing, hairdressing, and accessorizing that could take one or two hours for a woman of her class.

## The Process

%% GLO_TOILETTE.0004 %%
A complete toilette for a woman of Marie's social position involved:
- Bathing or washing
- Corset and undergarments
- Hairstyling (often with a maid's assistance; Marie is proud of doing her own hair)
- Choosing and putting on the dress, jacket, accessories
- Hat selection
- Gloves, parasol, fan as appropriate
- Final inspection in the mirror

## Social Significance

%% GLO_TOILETTE.0006 %%
The toilette was not mere grooming but a form of self-creation. Marie's diary entries frequently note outfit changes — she might change toilette multiple times in a day (from riding habit to afternoon dress to evening wear). The phrase "changer de toilette" (to change one's outfit) marks transitions between social contexts: promenade, salon, theater, dinner.

Marie describes her father wanting to watch her "faire sa toilette" to admire her figure, and she admits others to observe the process — it was less private than modern dressing, more a performance of beauty and refinement.
