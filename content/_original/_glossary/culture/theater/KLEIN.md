## Overview

Klein was a shop on the boulevards of Paris where Marie purchased small accessories in August 1873. The shop also displayed photographs, including portraits by the photographer Walery.

## Location

Located on the Paris boulevards, likely Boulevard des Italiens or Boulevard des Capucines, which were the fashionable shopping streets in the 1870s. The shop was passed multiple times during Marie's walks in Paris.

## Products

Marie purchases:
- A well-made, convenient purse for 22 francs
- Describes it as "très bien, et commode"

## Photographs Display

Klein displayed photographs in the shop windows, including:
- A portrait of Gioia by photographer Walery
- The photograph shows Gioia at "second cadre" (second frame)
- Multiple poses of Gioia in different frames

## Significance in Marie's Diary

The Klein shop becomes significant because:
- Marie sees Gioia's photograph there and is struck by her beauty
- This leads Marie to inquire about the photographer (Walery)
- Marie subsequently arranges her own photo session with Walery
- Marie obsessively returns to look at Gioia's portrait multiple times
- She wants to determine if Gioia is truly as beautiful as the photograph suggests

Marie's repeated returns to Klein to study Gioia's photograph reveal her jealousy and insecurity about her rival for the Duke of Hamilton's affections.
