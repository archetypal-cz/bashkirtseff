# La Grande-Duchesse de Gerolstein

## Overview

*La Grande-Duchesse de Gerolstein* is an opera bouffe in three acts by Jacques Offenbach, with a libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halevy. It premiered in Paris on April 12, 1867, during the Exposition Universelle, and starred Hortense Schneider in the title role.

## Plot

A satirical critique of unthinking militarism: a spoiled Grand Duchess falls in love with a common soldier named Fritz, promoting him rapidly through the ranks. The work parodies German petty principalities and military culture.

## Historical Context

The premiere was attended by European royalty including Napoleon III, the future Edward VII, Tsar Alexander II, Franz-Joseph of Austria-Hungary, and Bismarck. It became one of Offenbach's greatest successes and remains in the operatic repertoire.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie attends a performance at the Nice theater on October 7, 1875 (046.0509). She notes it has been "bien longtemps" since she last saw it, but leaves after the second act, escorted by Bihovetz and Barnola. The operetta's theme of a powerful woman obsessed with an unworthy man may have resonated with her own situation vis-a-vis Audiffret.
