# Giroflé-Girofla

## Overview

An opéra bouffe in three acts with music by Charles Lecocq and libretto by Albert Vanloo and Eugène Leterrier. Premiered at the Théâtre des Fantaisies Parisiennes, Brussels, on 21 March 1874.

## Plot

Set in 13th-century Spain, the story concerns twin brides — Giroflé and Girofla — one of whom is abducted by pirates. The other twin must pose as both brides until the first is rescued.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie uses the names from this operetta as nicknames throughout her diary from mid-1875 onward:
- **Girofla** = Emile d'Audiffret (the young man who courts then abandons Marie)
- **Giroflé** = Olga Sapogenikoff (Marie's close friend, paired with Audiffret in the joke)

The operetta was performed at the Nice theater on 30 September 1875 (carnet 045), which Marie calls "la pièce de famille" (the family piece) because of these nickname associations. The repeated use of "Giroflé" and "Girofla" during the performance amuses Marie's entire group.

## Historical Context

The Paris production at the Renaissance theater ran for 220 performances, earning over 700,000 francs — one of the most successful musical productions of the 1870s. It was performed internationally across Europe, the Americas, and Australia.
