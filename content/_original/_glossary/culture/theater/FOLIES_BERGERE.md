A famous Parisian music hall opened in 1869 on rue Richer (9th arrondissement). By 1881, it was one of Paris's most popular entertainment venues, featuring variety shows, operettas, and spectacles.

## Historical Context
The Folies-Bergère epitomized late 19th-century Parisian nightlife. It attracted a mixed crowd: bourgeois men, artists, prostitutes ("cocottes"), tourists. The promenade areas and bars were known for sexual commerce alongside the staged entertainment.

## Social Atmosphere
The venue combined respectable theater with demi-monde culture. Women of questionable reputation mingled with male clientele in the corridors and bars. The atmosphere was smoky, loud, and charged with sexual possibility - both thrilling and scandalous for respectable women.

## In Art and Literature
The Folies-Bergère became an iconic subject for Impressionist painters (notably Manet's 1882 masterpiece "A Bar at the Folies-Bergère") and naturalist writers like Zola who documented Parisian life.

## Diary References
- February 24, 1881: Marie, disguised as "Pauline Orell" with a thick veil and black wig, visits the Folies-Bergère with Alexis (also in disguise), her aunt, and the princess. She describes:
  - The atmosphere reminding her of the Opéra ball
  - "Petites cocottes" everywhere
  - Léa d'Asco in a nearby box with men
  - The noise of the orchestra and crowd (which helps Marie hear better)
  - Drinking champagne with a woman at the bar counter
  - Alexis pretending to be a painter with Marie as his model
  - The smell of tobacco and "mauvais lieu" (bad place/brothel)
  - Watching heavily made-up women and the "trottoir" (streetwalkers)

## Marie's Experience
Marie adopts a Zolaesque observer stance, claiming scientific detachment while clearly excited by the transgression. The disguise allows her to experience the demi-monde safely. Significantly, this "mauvais lieu" experience somehow leads her thoughts back to Cassagnac.
