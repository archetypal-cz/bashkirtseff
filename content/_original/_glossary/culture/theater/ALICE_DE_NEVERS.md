# Alice de Nevers

## Overview

Opera bouffe in 3 acts and 5 tableaux, with words and music by Herve (Florimond Ronger, 1825-1892). First performed at the Folies-Dramatiques in Paris on 22 April 1875.

## Historical Context

Herve was one of the founders of French operetta, alongside Offenbach. Alice de Nevers was not considered a success in Paris. Herve himself played the role of the Prince de Ferrare in the premiere, alongside Milher, Marie Perier, and Marie Desclauzas.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie attends the Nice premiere of Alice de Nevers on 20 October 1875 (carnet 047). The evening is significant not for the operetta itself (Marie finds it confusing: "Quelle drole de piece! je n'ai rien compris") but for the social drama: Audiffret visits her theater box during the performance, their first private encounter after his return to Nice. Marie wears a Marie-Antoinette hairstyle and feels she makes a strong impression. The audience gives Herve an ovation, but also boos: "La piece n'ira pas loin."
