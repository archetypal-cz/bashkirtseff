# Frou-Frou

## Overview

Comedy in five acts by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halevy, first performed at the Gymnase Dramatique, Paris, on 30 October 1869. Written exclusively for the actress Aimee Desclee.

## Plot

The play tells the story of Gilberte Brigard, nicknamed "Frou-Frou" (from the rustling sound of silk), a beautiful but frivolous young woman who marries the diplomat M. de Sartorys. After having a child, she abandons her family for the charming rake De Valreas, leaving her child in the care of her sister Louise. The story ends tragically.

## Historical Context

The title role became one of the great parts of 19th-century French theater, later performed by Sarah Bernhardt, Helena Modjeska, and Ellen Terry. The French expression "frou-frou" refers to the rustle of silk, evoking fondness for fine clothing and frivolity.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie's aunt retells the plot of Frou-Frou on 18 October 1875 (carnet 047), making pointed "applications" — drawing parallels to Marie's own situation. The aunt warns that once married, Marie should not return to Nice because "ce. ne se mariera jamais, et qu'il y aura un roman" — implying Audiffret will remain unmarried and a romantic entanglement would follow. The play's theme of a woman ruined by returning to a former suitor resonates with the aunt's warning.
