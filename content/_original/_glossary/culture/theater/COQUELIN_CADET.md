## Overview

%% GLO_COQUELIN_CADET.0002 %%
Alexandre Honoré Ernest Coquelin (1848-1909), known as Coquelin cadet ("the younger Coquelin"), was a French actor and comedian at the Comédie-Française. He was the younger brother of the more famous Constant Coquelin (Coquelin aîné), who created the role of Cyrano de Bergerac. Coquelin cadet was renowned for his comic monologues and his portrayal of eccentric characters. He was a sociétaire (full member) of the Comédie-Française from 1879.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_COQUELIN_CADET.0004 %%
Marie attended performances at the Comédie-Française and other Parisian theaters regularly during her years in Paris (1877-1884). The Coquelin brothers were among the most celebrated actors of the era. Marie's theater-going was both a social activity (being seen in the right boxes) and a genuine cultural engagement — she analyzed performances with the critical eye she applied to all art.
