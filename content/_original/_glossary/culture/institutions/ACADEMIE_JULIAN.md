## Overview

%% GLO_ACADEMIE_JULIAN.0002 %%
The Académie Julian was a private art school in Paris founded in 1868 by the painter Rodolphe Julian (1839-1907). Unlike the state-run École des Beaux-Arts, which did not admit women until 1897, the Académie Julian accepted female students from the start, making it one of the few serious art training venues open to women in 19th-century Paris.

## Organization

%% GLO_ACADEMIE_JULIAN.0004 %%
The school operated multiple ateliers at various locations across Paris, most notably in the Passage des Panoramas and on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis. Studios were separated by gender. The women's atelier was supervised by prominent academic painters including Tony Robert-Fleury and Jules Lefebvre. Students worked from live models (including male nudes in women's classes, a privilege not available at state institutions), drew from plaster casts, and submitted work for regular critiques by visiting instructors.

Fees for women were higher than for men — approximately 500 francs per year versus 300 — reflecting both the higher costs of separate supervision and the captive market, since women had so few alternatives. Despite this disparity, the school attracted students from across Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, and the Americas.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_ACADEMIE_JULIAN.0007 %%
Marie Bashkirtseff enrolled at the Académie Julian in October 1877 and it became the central focus of her life until her death in 1884. She studied primarily under Tony Robert-Fleury and Jules Lefebvre, working intensively on drawing, painting from life models, and preparing submissions for the Salon.

Marie's diary entries from her years at the Académie are among the most detailed surviving accounts of women's art education in 19th-century Paris. She describes the competitive atmosphere among women students, the significance of the weekly concours (competitions), the dynamics between male teachers and female students, and the practical challenges of working in crowded ateliers.

%% GLO_ACADEMIE_JULIAN.0009 %%
The school's founder, Rodolphe Julian (whom Marie calls "M. Julian" or "le père Julian"), appears frequently as a supportive but commercially minded figure. He recognized Marie's talent and ambition, and his encouragement — along with Robert-Fleury's criticism — drove much of her artistic development.

## Historical Significance

%% GLO_ACADEMIE_JULIAN.0011 %%
The Académie Julian played a crucial role in women's access to professional art training before the École des Beaux-Arts opened its doors to them. Notable alumni include Louise Catherine Breslau, Cecilia Beaux, Elizabeth Nourse, and many of the first generation of professionally trained women artists. The school continued operating until 1968 and was later absorbed into the ESAG Penninghen design school.
