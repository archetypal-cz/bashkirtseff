## Overview

Marie Bashkirtseff frequently code-switches to English in her diary, using it deliberately for specific emotional and social registers. This reflects her cosmopolitan education and social milieu in Nice and Paris where English-speaking visitors were common.

## Functions of Code-Switching

Marie uses English for:
- **Emotional intensity**: English words for feelings and dramatic moments
- **Sophistication markers**: Fashion terms, social terminology
- **Privacy/discretion**: Sensitive matters she wanted less accessible
- **Cultural affinity**: Demonstrating cosmopolitan education
- **Dialogue**: Quoting English-speaking acquaintances
- **Literary quotation**: References to English literature

## Common English Words in Marie's Diary

- "heart-broken", "bewilderment"
- "fashionable", "waterproof"
- "nonsenses", "flirtation"
- "shocking", "dreadful"

## Usage Notes

- When Marie writes in English within a paragraph, tag it with #English
- If the paragraph also contains French (usual case), also tag with #French
- If a paragraph is entirely in English, only tag with #English (no #French)

## Translator Notes

When Marie uses English, she is making a deliberate linguistic choice. Consider:
- Preserving the code-switch in translation (keeping English words)
- Adding translator notes explaining the significance
- The emotional register English carries for Marie
