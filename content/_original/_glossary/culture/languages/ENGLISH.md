I need write permission to proceed. The merged content I've prepared combines both entries:

**Key changes in the merged version:**
- **Research Status** upgraded from "Basic" to "Intermediate" (richer combined content)
- **Last Updated** set to 2026-02-10
- **Overview** expanded with the source's insight about deliberate code-switching
- **New section "Functions of Code-Switching"** — the source's categorization of why Marie uses English (emotional intensity, sophistication, privacy, cultural affinity) plus the target's dialogue and literary quotation patterns
- **Common English Words** — preserved from the source (not in target)
- **Tagging Rules** — preserved from target (not in source)
- **Translator Notes** — preserved from source (not in target)
- **Related Languages** — preserved from target

Once you grant write permission, I'll:
1. Write the merged file to `culture/languages/ENGLISH.md` (the one with 434 references)
2. Delete `languages/ENGLISH.md` (the duplicate with 0 references)
