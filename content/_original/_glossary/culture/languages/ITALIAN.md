I need your permission to write to the glossary files. Could you approve the write so I can save the merged ITALIAN.md entry?

The merged entry combines:
- Target's tagging rules and overview
- Source's specific Italian phrases ("a più non posso", "buia compagna", "cosa rarissima")
- Source's detailed usage categories (musical terms, artistic expressions, etc.)
- Source's translator notes about code-switching signals
- Updated research status to "Intermediate" and date to 2026-02-10

After writing, I'll also delete the duplicate at `_glossary/languages/ITALIAN.md` (which has zero references pointing to it — all 99 refs use the `culture/languages/` path).
