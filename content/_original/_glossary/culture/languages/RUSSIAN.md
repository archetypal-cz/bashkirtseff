## Overview

Russian is Marie's native family language. While she writes her diary in French, she occasionally uses Russian words, especially for family terms, emotional expressions, or when quoting family members.

## Usage Notes

- When Marie writes in Russian within a paragraph, tag it with #Russian
- If the paragraph also contains French (usual case), also tag with #French
- If a paragraph is entirely in Russian, only tag with #Russian (no #French)

## Common Patterns

- Family terms (diminutives, endearments)
- Quotations from family members
- Expressions of strong emotion
- References to Russian customs
