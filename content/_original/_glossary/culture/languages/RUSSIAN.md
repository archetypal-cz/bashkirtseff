It seems file write permissions haven't been granted yet. Could you approve the write permission so I can save the merged glossary entry? I need to:

1. **Write** the merged content to `culture/languages/RUSSIAN.md` (the target/canonical path)
2. **Delete** `languages/RUSSIAN.md` (the old flat-path duplicate)

The merged entry combines:
- The target's structure and tagging guidelines
- The source's specific vocabulary examples ("Moussia", "diadia", "Michka", "Vassya", "stariovoi", etc.)
- The source's translator-oriented code-switching notes
- Upgraded research status to "Intermediate" given the richer combined content
- Added "Iconostase" and "Lavra" from LAN comments found in actual diary entries
