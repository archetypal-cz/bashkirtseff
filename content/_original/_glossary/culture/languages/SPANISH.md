## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_SPANISH.0004 %%
Marie occasionally encounters Spanish speakers in the cosmopolitan social circles of Nice, Rome, and Paris, though Spanish is far less prominent in her diary than French, English, Italian, Russian, or German. Her multilingual upbringing and interest in languages means she notes Spanish phrases and speakers when she encounters them.
