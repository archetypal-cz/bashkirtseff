## Overview

Reference to a member of the Howard family and the *Swiss Times*, a local English-language newspaper. In the 19th century, English-language newspapers were published in many European cities with significant British expatriate populations. These papers covered local society news, arrivals and departures of notable visitors, and events of interest to the anglophone community.

The Howard family were close neighbors and friends of the Bashkirtseffs in Nice. A Howard family member's connection to a Swiss newspaper reflects the interconnected world of the British expatriate community along the Riviera and in Switzerland, where many of the same families moved between resort towns.
