## Overview

%% GLO_MORNING_POST.0002 %%
*The Morning Post* was a conservative British daily newspaper published in London from 1772 to 1937, when it was absorbed by *The Daily Telegraph*. During the 19th century, it was the preferred newspaper of the British aristocracy and the social elite, known for its Court Circular, society columns, and coverage of fashionable events. It had a notably Tory political orientation.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_MORNING_POST.0004 %%
Marie encountered *The Morning Post* through the large British expatriate community on the French Riviera, particularly in Nice. The paper's society columns tracked the movements of the British aristocracy — who was wintering in Nice, who attended which events, who was engaged or married. For Marie, who was keenly interested in the social hierarchy and the comings and goings of the elite, *The Morning Post* provided intelligence about the British social world she aspired to enter.

The Duke of Hamilton, Marie's early romantic obsession, would have appeared in its pages as a prominent Scottish nobleman.

## Historical Context

%% GLO_MORNING_POST.0007 %%
British newspapers circulated widely in the international resort towns of the Riviera, Spa, Baden-Baden, and Rome, where large English-speaking communities maintained their reading habits abroad. Reading *The Morning Post* was itself a social marker — it identified one as belonging to or aspiring to the upper classes.
