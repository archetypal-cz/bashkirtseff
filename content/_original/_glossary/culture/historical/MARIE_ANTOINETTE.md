Marie-Antoinette (1755-1793), Queen of France, wife of Louis XVI, executed during the French Revolution. Her tragic life and death became a subject of intense literary and historical interest in the 19th century.

## Historical Context
Marie-Antoinette's story - from Austrian archduchess to French queen to revolutionary prisoner - captured 19th-century French imagination. Her execution symbolized both the tragedy of the Revolution and the fall of the ancien régime.

## In Popular Culture
By the 1880s, numerous books, plays, and historical works explored Marie-Antoinette's life, often emphasizing her suffering and nobility in captivity. She was frequently portrayed sympathetically as a victim rather than as the frivolous "Madame Deficit" of revolutionary propaganda.

## Diary References
- February 22, 1881: Saint-Amand brings Marie a book he wrote, "Les dernières années de Marie-Antoinette" (The Last Years of Marie-Antoinette). Marie finds it "charmant" and notes that "Marie-Antoinette est un sujet à tirer éternellement des larmes" (Marie-Antoinette is a subject that eternally draws tears).

## Marie's Response
Marie's emotional response to Marie-Antoinette's story may reflect her own sense of victimhood and tragedy. The doomed queen's isolation and suffering would resonate with Marie's feelings of being trapped and misunderstood.
