## Overview

%% GLO_THERMAL_CURE.0002 %%
A cure thermale (thermal cure or spa treatment) was a course of medical treatment at a thermal spa, typically involving bathing in or drinking mineral waters believed to have healing properties. In the 19th century, thermal cures were a cornerstone of medical practice, prescribed for a wide range of ailments including respiratory diseases, rheumatism, skin conditions, and nervous disorders.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_THERMAL_CURE.0008 %%
Marie's doctors prescribed thermal cures for her respiratory ailments, but these trips were as much social as medical. The spa towns attracted the European elite, and the routine of treatment was interspersed with promenades, concerts, casino visits, and the elaborate social rituals that Marie describes in detail.

Marie's ambivalence about these cures reflects her priorities: she resents being sent away from Paris and her painting at the Académie Julian, yet she cannot deny the medical necessity. Dr. Krishaber offered her a choice between Mont-Dore and the sea; she chose Dieppe partly because the Karageorgevitch family were there.

## Historical Context

%% GLO_THERMAL_CURE.0011 %%
Thermal cures were both genuine medical practice and social institution. Before the germ theory of disease was widely accepted, the therapeutic properties of mineral waters were taken very seriously by the medical establishment. The spa towns developed elaborate infrastructure — pump rooms, bath houses, hotels, casinos, promenades — that made them major tourist destinations as well as medical facilities.
