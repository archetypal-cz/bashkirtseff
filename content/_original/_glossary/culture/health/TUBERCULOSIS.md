## Overview

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0002 %%
Tuberculosis (TB), known in the 19th century as "phtisie" (phthisis) or "consomption" (consumption), was the leading cause of death in Europe throughout the 1800s. The disease primarily attacks the lungs but can affect other organs. It was not understood to be caused by a bacterium (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*) until Robert Koch's discovery in 1882 — during Marie's lifetime.

## Period Terminology

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0004 %%
Marie and her doctors use several period terms:
- **Phtisie** — the standard medical term, from Greek *phthisis* (wasting)
- **Consomption** — consumption; the body "consumed" by disease
- **Fluxion de poitrine** — pneumonia/lung inflammation (a related condition)
- **Le poumon est malade** — the lung is diseased
- **Péri-bronchite chronique** — chronic peri-bronchitis (a euphemistic diagnosis)
- **Laryngite** — laryngitis (throat manifestation of TB)

## Marie's Illness

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0006 %%
Marie's tuberculosis is a slow-burning thread through the diary, becoming increasingly dominant:
- **Early symptoms** (from ~1876): Persistent laryngitis, recurring colds, coughing, throat problems
- **Growing severity** (1880-1881): "Voilà quatre ans que je soigne chez les plus célèbres docteurs une laryngite" — four years of treatment by famous doctors
- **Diagnosis clarification** (1881): Dr. Potain and Dr. Chairon confirm lung disease: "l'enveloppe du poumon droit est malade" (the membrane of the right lung is diseased)
- **Progressive hearing loss**: Connected to the throat/lung disease by doctors
- **Marie's response**: Alternating between terror, denial, and defiant irony: "mes assassins de docteurs" (my murderous doctors)

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0007 %%
Marie died of tuberculosis on October 31, 1884, at age 25.

## Medical Context

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0009 %%
In the 1870s-1880s, treatment for tuberculosis was limited to:
- **Climate therapy**: Moving to warm, dry climates (Nice, the Riviera) or mountain air
- **Thermal cures**: Spa treatments at places like Mont-Dore
- **Rest and nutrition**: Fresh air, good food, limited exertion
- **Various medications**: Mostly ineffective tonics and preparations
- The diagnosis itself was often concealed from patients or softened with euphemisms

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0010 %%
Koch's identification of the tubercle bacillus in March 1882 was a landmark, but effective treatment (streptomycin) would not arrive until 1944. In Marie's time, the disease remained essentially untreatable.

## Cultural Significance

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0012 %%
TB had a peculiar cultural mystique in the 19th century. It was associated with artistic genius, heightened sensibility, and romantic beauty — the "white plague" that seemed to refine its victims even as it killed them. Poets (Keats), musicians (Chopin), novelists (the Brontës), and Marie herself all fit this tragic archetype. The irony was not lost on Marie, who was consumed by ambition to create lasting art even as the disease consumed her body.

## Doctors in Marie's Diary

%% GLO_TUBERCULOSIS.0014 %%
- **Krishaber** — whose treatment Marie blames for worsening her condition
- **Potain** — whom she asks to exaggerate her illness to her family
- **Chairon** — who gives her the frank truth she demands about her lung
- Various unnamed doctors she refers to collectively as "mes assassins"
