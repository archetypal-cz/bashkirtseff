## Thematic Tag: Food & Dining

%% GLO_FOOD.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie mentions food, meals, dining, restaurants, or culinary topics. Food references in the diary reveal social customs, family dynamics, class indicators, and Marie's own relationship with eating and appearance.

## Common References

%% GLO_FOOD.0005 %%
## Notable Patterns

%% GLO_FOOD.0006 %%
- Marie describes dining more as social setting than culinary experience — she is more interested in who sat where and what was said than in what was eaten
- Food served at others' homes is judged as a reflection of the host's generosity and wealth
- Travel meals (hotel dining, restaurant stops) mark transitions between locations
- Chocolate (chocolat) appears both as a drink and as a person's nickname
