## Thematic Tag: Fourth Wall

%% GLO_FOURTH_WALL.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie directly addresses her future readers, breaks the fiction of writing "for herself alone," and acknowledges the public nature of her private text. These moments are among the most distinctive and modern features of the diary.

## Marie's Reader-Awareness

%% GLO_FOURTH_WALL.0004 %%
Marie constantly oscillates between two claims: that her diary is strictly private ("je n'ecris que pour moi") and that it will one day be read by the world. She addresses her phantom audience with remarkable directness:
- **"Vous qui me lisez"** — direct address to future readers
- **"Celui qui lira"** / **"celle qui lira"** — the imagined individual reader
- **"On me lira"** — confident assertion that the diary will find its audience
- **"Ceux qui liront ces lignes"** — appeals to posterity

## Significance

%% GLO_FOURTH_WALL.0006 %%
These passages reveal Marie's fundamental paradox: the diary is simultaneously her most intimate space and a carefully constructed literary performance. She writes with one eye on the page and one eye on posterity. This self-consciousness about audience — rare in 19th-century diaries — makes Marie's text feel strikingly contemporary. The fourth-wall breaks intensify as her illness progresses and the urgency of being remembered grows.

## Notable Patterns

%% GLO_FOURTH_WALL.0008 %%
- Early diary (1873-76): Occasional reader-addresses, often playful
- Middle period (1876-80): More frequent, tied to ambition and desire for fame
- Late diary (1880-84): Urgent, existential — the diary as her legacy, her survival after death
