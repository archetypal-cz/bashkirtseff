## Marie's Religious Life

%% GLO_RELIGION.0004 %%
Marie was raised in the Russian Orthodox tradition but lived in a predominantly Catholic society in Nice and Paris. Her diary reveals a complex, intensely personal relationship with God — she prays fervently, bargains, pleads, and rages. Her faith is neither conventional piety nor systematic theology but a passionate, almost transactional dialogue with the divine.

## Common Patterns

%% GLO_RELIGION.0006 %%
- **Prayer as negotiation**: Marie asks God for specific outcomes — romantic success, artistic recognition, healing
- **Church attendance**: Both as social ritual and genuine devotion; visiting churches in Rome, Nice, Paris
- **Existential questioning**: As illness progresses, Marie's prayers become more desperate — "priant Dieu de me laisser mourir"
- **Religious objects and rituals**: Icons, candles, confession, Orthodox feast days
- **Religious art**: Marie encounters religious art in churches and museums, judging it with her artist's eye
- **Superstition**: Fortune-telling, omens, and semi-religious folk beliefs coexist with formal faith
