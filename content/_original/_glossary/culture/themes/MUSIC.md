%% GLO_MUSIC_THEME.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie discusses music — attending concerts, opera, operetta, her own singing and musical studies, and music as emotional experience.

## Marie's Musical Life

%% GLO_MUSIC_THEME.0004 %%
Before Marie dedicated herself to painting, music — specifically singing — was her primary artistic pursuit. She studied voice seriously and possessed genuine talent. Even after choosing visual art, music remained a passionate interest:
- **Opera attendance**: Regular at the Nice opera and Paris theaters
- **Concert-going**: Both as social activity and genuine artistic engagement
- **Salon musicales**: Private musical evenings in aristocratic homes
- **"La musique"**: In Nice, the afternoon public concerts on the Promenade or in parks, a daily social ritual

## Key Musical References

%% GLO_MUSIC_THEME.0006 %%
- **Opera**: Verdi (*Un ballo in maschera*), operetta (Lecocq's *Giroflé-Girofla*)
- **"La musique"**: Daily public concerts in Nice, a social promenade with musical accompaniment
- **Singing**: Marie's own vocal studies and performances
- **Bach, and other composers**: Classical repertoire encountered in concerts

## Significance

%% GLO_MUSIC_THEME.0008 %%
Music serves multiple functions in the diary: aesthetic experience, social setting (the opera box as display), emotional trigger, and measure of cultural sophistication. Marie's abandonment of a potential singing career in favor of painting is one of the diary's key turning points.
