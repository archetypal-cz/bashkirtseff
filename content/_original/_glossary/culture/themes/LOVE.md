## Marie's Romantic Life

%% GLO_LOVE.0004 %%
Love is the diary's emotional engine, especially in the earlier years. Marie's romantic attachments follow a pattern: intense, consuming, typically one-sided, and always intertwined with her ambition:
- **Duke of Hamilton** (1873-76): The foundational obsession; an older, unattainable aristocrat whom Marie observes from a distance
- **Count Pietro Antonelli** (1876): A brief Roman flirtation
- **Emile de Girardin / Audiffret / various** (1875-78): Cascading infatuations
- **Paul de Cassagnac** (1878-80): Political journalist; admiration through his writing
- **Guy de Maupassant** (1884): Late, literary attraction

## Love and Ambition

%% GLO_LOVE.0006 %%
Marie's great tension is between love and independence. She desires passionate love but fears it will consume her art. "Si j'aime, je suis perdue" — if I love, I am lost. Marriage represents both fulfillment and the end of autonomy. This conflict gives the diary its distinctive energy: she is simultaneously desperate for love and determined to transcend it through artistic glory.
