## Thematic Tag: Travel

%% GLO_TRAVEL.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie describes travel — departures, arrivals, journeys by train, carriage, or ship, hotel stays, and the experience of moving between the many places she inhabited.

## Marie's Geography

%% GLO_TRAVEL.0004 %%
Marie's life was extraordinarily mobile. She moved regularly between:
- **Nice** — winter home, social season (1873-1877, returns later)
- **Paris** — primary residence from 1877; art studies at Académie Julian
- **Rome** — extended stays for carnival and social season
- **Russia** (Poltava, Gavroncy) — family estates, summer visits
- **Spa towns** — Schwalbach, Soden, Mont-Dore, Dieppe, Spa, Baden-Baden
- **Italy** — Rome, Naples, various cities
- **Spain** — Seville, brief visit
- **Germany** — multiple spa and social visits

## Travel as Narrative

%% GLO_TRAVEL.0006 %%
Journeys mark major transitions in the diary. Marie describes the practical details of 19th-century travel — reserving train coupés, packing, the quality of hotel accommodations, the length of carriage rides ("cinq heures de voiture") — and uses departures and arrivals as emotional punctuation. Leaving a city often triggers reflection; arriving in a new one sparks anticipation or dread.

## Transportation

%% GLO_TRAVEL.0008 %%
- **Train**: The primary long-distance transport; Marie notes train types (omnibus vs. express), compartment types (coupé), and travel companions
- **Carriage**: For city and regional travel; calèche, landau, fiacre, etc.
- **Ship**: For Mediterranean crossings
- **On foot**: Walking as both exercise and social activity
