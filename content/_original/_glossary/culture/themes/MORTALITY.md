## Thematic Tag: Mortality & Death Obsession

%% GLO_MORTALITY.0002 %%
This broad thematic tag captures Marie's pervasive preoccupation with death, dying, and killing — both literal and figurative. Marie uses death vocabulary constantly throughout the diary: as emotional hyperbole, philosophical meditation, social commentary, and increasingly as confrontation with her own mortality. This is one of the diary's most distinctive rhetorical features.

## Figurative Death in Marie's Writing

%% GLO_MORTALITY.0004 %%
Marie's signature style deploys death language for emotional intensity:
- "Je suis comme morte de ne pas l'avoir vu" — I am as if dead from not having seen him
- "Il est mort, il n'est plus" — He is dead, he is no more (about Hamilton's changed behavior)
- "Sans hommes, c'est la mort" — Without men, it's death
- "les etes a Nice me tuent" — summers in Nice kill me
- "notre vie m'assassine" — our life assassinates me
- "ce proces qui empoisonne notre vie" — this lawsuit that poisons our life

- **Early years (1873-1876)**: Death as dramatic hyperbole and emotional weapon; occasional real deaths (cholera, illnesses)
- **Middle years (1877-1879)**: Growing philosophical preoccupation; death as existential concept
- **Later years (1880-1882)**: Increasingly personal as illness progresses; Marie contemplates suicide and her own mortality
- **Final years (1883-1884)**: Death shifts from metaphor to approaching reality; "je me laisserai mourir"
