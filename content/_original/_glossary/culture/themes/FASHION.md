## Thematic Tag: Fashion & Dress

%% GLO_FASHION.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie discusses clothing, fashion, dressmakers, personal appearance, and style. Fashion is one of the diary's most pervasive themes — Marie records her outfits with systematic precision and judges others' dress with expert severity.

%% GLO_FASHION.0003 %%
## Marie's Outfit Notation

%% GLO_FASHION.0004 %%
Marie developed a distinctive parenthetical shorthand for recording her outfits:
- "(robe bleue et or Worth, nouvelle, bien)" — blue and gold Worth dress, new, good
- "(robe marron Worth, jaquette Manby, col de Paris, bien)" — with ratings
- "(robe blanche piqué, chapeau mousquetaire, bien)" — white pique dress, musketeer hat, good

%% GLO_FASHION.0005 %%
## Key Fashion Houses

%% GLO_FASHION.0006 %%
- **Worth** — Charles Frederick Worth, the father of haute couture; Marie's primary dressmaker
- **Laferrière** — Parisian dressmaker ("me fait des merveilles de simplicité")
- **Reboux** — milliner ("des tableaux de chapeaux" — paintings of hats)
- **Doucet** — fashion house; Marie buys a tulle veil for 100 francs
- **Ferry** — shoemaker ("des poèmes de chaussures" — poems of shoes)
- **Jouvin** — glove maker
- **Virot** — milliner

%% GLO_FASHION.0007 %%

- **Amazone** — riding habit for side-saddle
- **Jaquette** — jacket

%% GLO_FASHION.0009 %%
## Significance

%% GLO_FASHION.0010 %%
For Marie, dress was not vanity but strategy. In a world where a woman's appearance was her primary form of public expression, clothing choices communicated wealth, taste, social aspiration, and personal identity. Marie's meticulous outfit records, with their ratings ("bien," "très bien," "mal"), represent a conscious self-fashioning — she is curating her public image with the same attention she would later bring to painting.
