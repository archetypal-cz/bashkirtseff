## Thematic Tag: Meta-Diary

%% GLO_META_DIARY.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie writes about the diary itself — the act of writing, her reasons for keeping a journal, reflections on what she has written, and self-conscious commentary on the text as object.

%% GLO_META_DIARY.0003 %%
## Marie's Self-Reflection on Writing

%% GLO_META_DIARY.0004 %%
Marie frequently steps back from narrating her life to comment on the narration itself:
- **"Mon journal"** / **"ce journal"** — referring to the diary as entity
- **"Ce cahier"** / **"ce carnet"** — the physical notebook
- **"J'ecris"** / **"en ecrivant"** — the act of writing
- **"Ces pages"** / **"ces lignes"** — the text she is producing
- **"Relire"** — re-reading previous entries, commenting on her past self

## Functions of Meta-Commentary

%% GLO_META_DIARY.0006 %%
- **Self-justification**: Why she writes, why the diary matters
- **Quality control**: Dissatisfaction with her own writing, wishing she could express herself better
- **Continuity**: Noting gaps, explaining why she hasn't written
- **Retrospection**: Re-reading old entries and commenting on her younger self
- **The diary as companion**: In loneliness and illness, the journal becomes her confidant

## Significance

%% GLO_META_DIARY.0008 %%
The meta-diary passages transform Marie's journal from a simple record of events into a self-aware literary project. She treats the diary not merely as a receptacle for thoughts but as a work in progress, subject to the same critical scrutiny she applies to her paintings. This reflexivity — writing about writing — gives the diary its distinctive layered quality.
