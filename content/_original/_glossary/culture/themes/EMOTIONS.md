## Thematic Tag: Emotions

%% GLO_EMOTIONS.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie explicitly names, analyzes, or dwells on her emotional states — not simply feeling emotions (every entry does that) but passages where emotion itself becomes the subject of reflection.

## Marie's Emotional Self-Awareness

%% GLO_EMOTIONS.0004 %%
Marie is extraordinary in her willingness to name and dissect her own emotions. She doesn't just feel; she observes herself feeling, catalogs her moods, and interrogates their causes. The diary is not merely an emotional outlet but a systematic study of her own inner life.
