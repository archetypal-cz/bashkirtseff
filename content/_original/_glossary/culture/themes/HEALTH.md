## Thematic Tag: Health & Illness

%% GLO_HEALTH.0002 %%
This thematic tag collects diary paragraphs where Marie discusses health, illness, medical treatment, doctors, and bodily symptoms. Health becomes an increasingly dominant theme as Marie's tuberculosis progresses, but concerns about the body — her own and others' — appear from the earliest entries.

## Trajectory

%% GLO_HEALTH.0004 %%
- **Early years (1873-1876)**: Occasional illness, colds; health mostly a background concern
- **Growing symptoms (1877-1879)**: Persistent laryngitis, recurring respiratory problems; medical consultations multiply
- **Diagnosis period (1880-1881)**: Hearing loss, confirmed lung disease; Marie confronts the reality of serious illness
- **Final years (1882-1884)**: Health dominates the diary; medical treatments, doctor visits, and the tension between illness and artistic ambition

## Key Medical Themes

%% GLO_HEALTH.0006 %%
- **Respiratory disease**: The central medical thread — coughing, fever, lung problems, ultimately tuberculosis
- **Hearing loss**: Progressive deafness that isolates Marie socially
- **Thermal cures**: Spa treatments at Mont-Dore, Dieppe, and other resorts
- **Doctor relationships**: Marie's complex attitudes toward her physicians — demanding truth, then raging at the diagnosis
- **Body and appearance**: Marie's awareness of how illness affects her looks — she checks the mirror for signs of emaciation

%% GLO_HEALTH.0007 %%
## Marie's Medical Language

%% GLO_HEALTH.0008 %%
- "mes assassins de docteurs" — my murderous doctors
- "Le poumon est dégagé" — the lung is clear
- "péri-bronchite chronique" — the euphemistic diagnosis
- "je tousse et étouffe" — I cough and choke
- "la température est toujours à 38,3" — precise fever readings
