## Marie's Political World

%% GLO_POLITICS.0004 %%
Marie lived through a turbulent period in French politics: the early Third Republic (established 1870), the aftermath of the Paris Commune, the conservative "Moral Order" government, the crisis of 16 May 1877, the consolidation of republican government, and the rise of colonial politics. She was also attentive to Russian, Italian, and British politics through her family connections and cosmopolitan circle.

## Marie's Political Attitudes

%% GLO_POLITICS.0008 %%
Marie's political views are complex and evolving. She is drawn to political drama as spectacle and follows political journalism avidly. Her social circle includes both Bonapartists and republicans. Her later engagement with feminist politics — particularly women's suffrage and access to the Salon — adds another dimension. She was one of the earliest supporters of Hubertine Auclert's women's rights campaign.
