## Marie as Philosopher

%% GLO_PHILOSOPHY.0004 %%
Marie is not a systematic thinker but an intensely philosophical one. She reads philosophers (Epictetus, La Rochefoucauld, Marcus Aurelius), but more importantly, she philosophizes spontaneously — interrogating the meaning of her own existence, the nature of glory, the purpose of suffering, and the relationship between individual destiny and universal truth.

## Key Philosophical Themes

%% GLO_PHILOSOPHY.0006 %%
- **Fame and legacy**: What survives death? Is glory worth pursuing? "La gloire" as transcendence
- **Meaning of suffering**: Why do the young die? What purpose does her illness serve?
- **Free will vs. destiny**: Is her life predetermined? Can she shape her fate through willpower?
- **Truth and self-deception**: Marie's obsession with sincerity, her distrust of social convention
- **The nature of the self**: Who is the "real" Marie? The diary as philosophical self-investigation
- **Moral philosophy**: Questions of right conduct, duty, honor, social norms
