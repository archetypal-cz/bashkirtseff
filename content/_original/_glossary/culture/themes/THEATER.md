## Marie at the Theater

%% GLO_THEATER_THEME.0004 %%
Theater was central to Marie's cultural and social life in both Nice and Paris:
- **Nice**: The theater and opera house as winter social venues; operettas, plays, and concerts
- **Paris**: The Comédie-Française, the Opéra, the boulevard theaters
- **Rome**: Performances during the carnival season

## Social Dimension

%% GLO_THEATER_THEME.0006 %%
Theater attendance was as much social as cultural. The choice of box, the visibility of one's seat, the opportunity to be seen during intermissions, and the chance to observe others — all these mattered as much as the performance itself. Marie records who she saw at the theater, what she wore, and the social interactions around the performance.

## Life as Theater

%% GLO_THEATER_THEME.0008 %%
Marie frequently uses theatrical metaphors for her own life — she is always conscious of performing, of being observed, of staging herself. This self-awareness gives the diary its distinctive quality: Marie is simultaneously the actress, the audience, and the critic.
