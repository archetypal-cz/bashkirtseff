# Maison Laferrière

## Overview

Maison Laferrière was a prestigious Parisian haute couture house founded by Madeleine Laferrière (1847-1912) in 1869 at 28, rue Taitbout, Paris. It was one of the leading fashion houses of the Second Empire and Third Republic, ranked alongside Doucet, Paquin, and Worth.

## Clientele

The house dressed European royalty (Queen Maud of Norway, Princess Alexandra of Wales) and celebrities (Sarah Bernhardt). Its reputation for exquisite design and workmanship made it a fixture of Parisian haute couture.

## Relevance to Marie

On 30 September 1875, Marie writes to Laferrière ordering new dresses, prompted by her rivalry with Gioia: "Cette femme est le trois-quarts de la femme. Soignons-nous trois-quarts." Marie sees fashion as a weapon in her competition with the courtesan.
