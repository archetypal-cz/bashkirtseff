# Maison Laferriere

## Overview

Maison Laferriere was a prestigious Parisian haute couture house founded by Madeleine Laferriere (1847-1912) in 1869 at 28, rue Taitbout, Paris. It was one of the leading fashion houses of the Second Empire and Third Republic, ranked alongside Doucet, Paquin, and Worth. Compared to Worth's "massif et severe" aesthetic, Laferriere offered a lighter, more refined style.

## Clientele

The house dressed European royalty (Queen Maud of Norway, Princess Alexandra of Wales) and celebrities (Sarah Bernhardt). Its reputation for exquisite design and workmanship made it a fixture of Parisian haute couture.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie considers Laferriere as an alternative to Worth for her clothing needs, favoring the lighter aesthetic.

### 1874

- **February 21**: Marie decides to switch from Worth: "de ne plus aller chez Worth, mais chez Laferriere et Querteux. Worth est trop massif et severe." This represents Marie's evolving fashion preferences.

### 1875

- **September 30**: Marie writes to Laferriere ordering new dresses, prompted by her rivalry with Gioia: "Cette femme est le trois-quarts de la femme. Soignons-nous trois-quarts." Marie sees fashion as a weapon in her competition with the courtesan.
