It seems I need permission to write to this file. Could you approve the write permission? I'm trying to save the merged glossary entry to the target file at `content/_original/_glossary/culture/fashion/LAFERRIERE.md`.

The merged content combines:
- TARGET's frontmatter and detailed historical info (founding, clientele)
- SOURCE's earlier 1874 diary reference (switching from Worth) with the quote
- TARGET's 1875 reference (ordering dresses, Gioia rivalry)
- Context about Laferrière vs Worth's aesthetic integrated into the overview

The source file at `people/mentioned/LAFERRIERE.md` has no references pointing to it (confirmed via grep), so it can be safely deleted after the merge.
