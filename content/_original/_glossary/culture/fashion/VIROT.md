## Overview

%% GLO_VIROT.0002 %%
Maison Virot was one of the most prestigious millinery houses in late 19th-century Paris, renowned for creating elaborate and fashionable hats. The house was run by Mme Virot, who was considered one of the leading modistes (milliners) of the era, alongside Reboux and others. Located in the fashionable commercial district near the Rue de la Paix, Virot dressed the heads of the Parisian elite and aristocracy.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_VIROT.0004 %%
Marie frequented the top Parisian fashion houses as part of her meticulous attention to appearance and self-presentation. Hats were a critical element of 19th-century women's fashion — no respectable woman appeared in public without one — and the choice of milliner signaled social status. Marie's patronage of Virot, alongside Worth (dresses), Reboux (hats), Laferrière (dresses), and Doucet (accessories), reflects her family's investment in maintaining their position in the highest social circles.

## Historical Context

%% GLO_VIROT.0006 %%
The 1870s-1880s were the golden age of Parisian millinery. Hats grew increasingly elaborate, incorporating feathers, ribbons, flowers, and complex structures. A hat from a top modiste like Virot could cost as much as a working-class family's monthly wages. The millinery trade employed thousands of women in Paris, from the prestigious modistes to the anonymous ouvrières who sewed in back rooms.
