## Overview

%% GLO_OMNIBUS.0002 %%
An omnibus (from Latin *omnibus*, "for all") was a large horse-drawn public transport vehicle operating on fixed routes, the predecessor of the modern bus. Introduced in Paris in 1828, omnibuses became a standard feature of urban transport in major European cities. The shortened form "bus" eventually displaced the original word.

## Social Significance

%% GLO_OMNIBUS.0006 %%
The omnibus was democratic transport — available to anyone who could pay the modest fare. For the upper classes like Marie's family, taking an omnibus was slightly declassé but not shocking, particularly when traveling to specific destinations. Marie mentions the omnibus both as actual transport and as a humorous metaphor for informal travel arrangements.

The term "train omnibus" was also used for local stopping trains (as opposed to express trains), appearing when Marie travels by rail.
