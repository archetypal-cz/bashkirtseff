## Overview

%% GLO_PHAETON.0002 %%
A phaéton (from the mythological Phaethon, who drove the sun chariot) is a light, open, four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage. In 19th-century usage, phaétons were sporty, owner-driven vehicles — unlike most carriages, the phaéton could be driven by the owner rather than a coachman, making it associated with personal dash and skill.

## Social Significance

%% GLO_PHAETON.0006 %%
The phaéton occupied an ambiguous social position. While it could be fashionable — a young gentleman driving his own phaéton cut a dashing figure — it was less formal than a landau or calèche with servants. Marie uses the phaéton to make a social judgment: when she sees Fedus in a phaéton rather than a fiacre, she notes that his own vehicle is actually more miserable than a hired cab would have been.
