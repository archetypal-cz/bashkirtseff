## Overview

%% GLO_CALECHE.0002 %%
A calèche (also spelled calash or caleche) is a light, elegant four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage with a folding hood or top. Derived from the German *Kalesche* (itself from the Czech *kolesa*, wheels), the calèche was one of the most fashionable carriages of the 19th century, especially suited for promenading and being seen in public.

## Description

The calèche typically featured:
- Four wheels, the front pair smaller than the rear
- A folding leather or fabric hood that could be raised in rain
- Open sides allowing occupants to see and be seen
- Seating for two to four passengers facing forward
- A coachman's seat at the front (the siège)
- Often drawn by two horses, sometimes by four for ceremonial occasions

## Social Significance

%% GLO_CALECHE.0006 %%
In Marie's world, the type of carriage one used was a powerful marker of social status. The calèche was more elegant than a fiacre (hired cab) and more fashionable than a closed voiture. Its open design was ideal for the ritual promenades on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, at the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, or along the Corso in Rome — occasions where the whole point was to display oneself, one's dress, one's horses, and one's social standing.

Owning a calèche with matched horses and liveried servants signaled considerable wealth. Marie notes the calèches of others with expert attention — the quality of the horses, the style of the livery, the elegance of the occupant.
