## Overview

%% GLO_VOITURE.0002 %%
"Voiture" is the general French word for carriage (and later, car). In Marie's diary, it most often refers to the family's private horse-drawn carriage, without specifying the exact type. When Marie writes "en voiture" (in the carriage), she typically means her family's own equipage, driven by their coachman, with the social display that implies.

## Social Significance

%% GLO_VOITURE.0004 %%
In 19th-century upper-class life, the private carriage was both essential transport and social theater. The "tour des voitures" at the Bois de Boulogne was a daily ritual of display — families paraded their carriages, horses, liveries, and occupants in a slow procession that functioned as a living social register. Marie's diary entries from Paris are full of these carriage circuits, noting who she saw, who saluted, and who cut whom.

Similarly on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, the afternoon carriage ride was the central social event. Marie records encounters with the Duke of Hamilton, Audiffret, and others almost exclusively from the vantage of the family voiture.

- **"voiture découverte"** — open carriage (display, fine weather)
- **"sa voiture"** — his/her own carriage (ownership = status)
- **"en voiture"** — riding in a carriage (vs. on horseback or on foot)
- **"descendre de voiture"** — getting out (to walk, to approach someone)
