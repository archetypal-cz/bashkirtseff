## Overview

A break (also spelled brake) is a large, open, four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage, originally designed for breaking in (training) young horses and later adopted as a sporting and excursion vehicle. The English word was used directly in French, reflecting the anglophilia of 19th-century French upper-class culture.
