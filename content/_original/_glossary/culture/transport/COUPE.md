## Overview

%% GLO_COUPE.0002 %%
A coupé (from French *couper*, to cut) is an enclosed horse-drawn carriage with a fixed roof, seating for two passengers, and a coachman's seat outside. The name indicates that it is "cut" — a shortened version of a larger coach, typically with only one interior compartment and a single door on each side.

## Social Significance

%% GLO_COUPE.0006 %%
The coupé was a respectable, practical carriage — more discreet than the open calèche, more intimate than the larger landau. It was associated with city driving, bad-weather travel, and occasions where display was less important than comfort and privacy. A "voiture fermée" (closed carriage) like a coupé could also mean discreet travel — Marie notes Gioia traveling "en voiture fermée avec un homme" in an early entry.
