## Overview

%% GLO_DROCHKI.0002 %%
A drochki (also droshky, дрожки) is a light, low, open Russian carriage on four wheels, originally little more than a bench mounted on a plank between two axles. Marie spells it "drochki" in the French manner. The vehicle is distinctively Russian and appears in the diary only during Marie's visits to Russia.

## Description

%% GLO_DROCHKI.0004 %%
Marie describes two variants:
- **Drochki de course** — a racing drochki: "une planche placée sur quatre roues" (a plank placed on four wheels), with a small coachman and a rustic lantern
- **Drochki à capote** — a drochki with a folding top, "attelé d'une troïka insensée" (hitched to a wild troika of three horses)

## Social Significance

%% GLO_DROCHKI.0006 %%
The drochki marks a shift in the diary's transportation vocabulary from the French/Western European world (calèche, landau, fiacre) to the Russian countryside. Marie describes the departure from the family estate as a procession: "un carrosse à quatre chevaux, une calèche, et un drochki à capote" — a full display of the family's Russian equipage.
