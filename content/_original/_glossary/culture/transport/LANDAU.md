## Overview

%% GLO_LANDAU.0002 %%
A landau is a four-wheeled, horse-drawn carriage named after the German city of Landau in der Pfalz, where it was first manufactured. Its distinguishing feature is two folding hoods that meet in the middle when raised, allowing the carriage to be fully enclosed in bad weather or opened on fine days. The landau was one of the most prestigious carriages of the 19th century.

## Social Significance

%% GLO_LANDAU.0006 %%
The landau was associated with wealth, formality, and social prestige. Its versatility — convertible from open to closed — made it suitable for both display promenades and private travel. A landau with matched horses and full livery was among the most visible symbols of upper-class status. Marie notes the color of the wheels ("landau à roues jaunes" — landau with yellow wheels), the livery, and the overall impression as markers of social standing.
