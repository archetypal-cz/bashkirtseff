## Overview

%% GLO_BAL.0002 %%
A bal (ball) was a formal social event centered on dancing, held in private homes, public venues, or dedicated ballrooms. Balls were among the most important social events of the 19th-century season, offering opportunities for display, courtship, and social advancement. The related forms include the bal masqué (masked ball), bal costumé (costume ball), and the more intimate soirée dansante.

## Marie at Balls

%% GLO_BAL.0008 %%
Marie describes balls with characteristic intensity — her dress, her partners, who noticed her, who ignored her, the music, the atmosphere. Carnival masked balls in Nice and Rome are particularly vivid. Marie also describes a ball organized by Baron Schenk at Soden specifically to meet her (1878-08-05, carnet 081), leading to the Dourassoff courtship episode.
