## Overview

%% GLO_AMAZONE.0002 %%
An amazone was a women's riding habit designed for side-saddle equitation. The term comes from the legendary Amazons, warrior women of Greek mythology. In 19th-century French, "en amazone" meant wearing a riding habit and riding side-saddle — the only socially acceptable way for a lady to ride.

## Description

The amazone typically consisted of:
- A long, full skirt (sometimes called a "riding skirt") that draped over the side-saddle
- A fitted jacket or bodice, often in a contrasting color
- A top hat (tube/chapeau haut-de-forme) or other riding hat
- Gloves and a riding crop
- Colors were usually dark (navy, black, grey) for elegance

## Social Significance

%% GLO_AMAZONE.0006 %%
Horseback riding was a prestigious social activity for women of the upper classes, and the amazone was itself a fashion statement. Marie notes her riding outfits with the same attention she gives to all her dress: "j'étais en amazone" appears as a fashion note alongside outfit ratings.

The amazone also indicated active, physical participation in outdoor life — riding was one of the few vigorous physical activities acceptable for women of Marie's class, alongside walking and, later, swimming.
