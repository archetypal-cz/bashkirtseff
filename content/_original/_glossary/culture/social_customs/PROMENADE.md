## Overview

%% GLO_PROMENADE.0002 %%
The promenade was a central social ritual of 19th-century upper-class life — a daily or near-daily public appearance, whether on foot, on horseback, or in a carriage, along established routes at established hours. The purpose was as much social as recreational: to see and be seen, to exchange greetings, to display one's dress, equipage, and social connections.

## Major Promenades in Marie's Life

%% GLO_PROMENADE.0004 %%
- **Promenade des Anglais, Nice**: The daily afternoon carriage ride along the seafront, the centerpiece of Nice's winter social season. Marie describes it obsessively in her early carnets — every sighting of the Duke of Hamilton, every outfit, every salutation.
- **Bois de Boulogne, Paris**: The "tour des voitures" — circuit of carriages through the park, the Parisian equivalent of Nice's promenade. Marie describes her first trip there in 1875: "Au deuxième tour des voitures, je me remets et regarde les gens avec une bienveillante condescendance."
- **Corso, Rome**: The evening carriage procession during carnival, with confetti battles and masking.
- **Promenade du Pincio, Rome**: Fashionable afternoon walk on the Pincian Hill.

## Social Significance

%% GLO_PROMENADE.0006 %%
The promenade was a performance. One's carriage, horses, livery, dress, and companions were all read as social text by the other participants. A greeting from the right person could elevate one's status; being cut (ignored) could devastate. Marie records these micro-interactions with extraordinary precision — who saluted, who turned to look, who approached the carriage, who merely passed.

For a young woman of Marie's social position, the promenade was both opportunity and constraint. She could display her beauty and elegance, but she could not approach men directly — she had to wait for them to approach the carriage, and she agonizes when they do not.
