## Overview

%% GLO_CARNAVAL.0002 %%
Carnival (carnaval) is the festive season preceding Lent, typically running from Epiphany (January 6) to Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday). In the Mediterranean cities Marie inhabited — Nice, Rome, and to some extent Paris — carnival was a major social event featuring masked balls, street processions, confetti battles, and a general atmosphere of festive license.

## Nice Carnival

%% GLO_CARNAVAL.0004 %%
The Nice carnival (Carnaval de Nice) was one of the largest in Europe, featuring:
- **Corso**: Procession of decorated carriages along the Promenade des Anglais
- **Bataille de confettis**: Confetti battles between carriages and spectators
- **Bataille de fleurs**: Flower battles (throwing bouquets)
- **Masking**: Wearing dominos (hooded cloaks) and masks
- **Decorated carriages**: Marie's family decorates a break in mauve sateen (1882)
- **Tribunes**: Grandstand seating for spectators

## Rome Carnival

%% GLO_CARNAVAL.0006 %%
The Roman carnival on the Corso was even more famous, described by Goethe and countless other travelers. Marie participates in the Corso in Rome in 1876, entering in "une large calèche, habillées de dominos blancs à gigantesques rayures indigo et des masques à lunettes."

## Social Significance

%% GLO_CARNAVAL.0008 %%
Carnival offered a temporary relaxation of social norms. Behind masks, one could speak to strangers, flirt more freely, and behave with a boldness impossible in daily life. For Marie, carnival combined the excitement of display with the freedom of anonymity: "sous le masque on dit des bêtises aux voitures qui passent et aux gens des tribunes et ça m'amuse tant."
