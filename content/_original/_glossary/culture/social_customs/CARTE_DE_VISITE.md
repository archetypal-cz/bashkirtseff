## Overview

%% GLO_CARTE_DE_VISITE.0002 %%
A carte de visite (visiting card or calling card) was a small printed card bearing a person's name, and sometimes their address and title, used as an essential instrument of 19th-century social interaction. The term also referred to a popular small-format photograph (approximately 6x9 cm) mounted on card stock, invented by André Adolphe Eugène Disdéri in 1854.

## Social Protocol

%% GLO_CARTE_DE_VISITE.0004 %%
Visiting cards governed the elaborate ritual of social calls:
- **Leaving a card**: When calling on someone who was not at home, one left a card with the servant, signaling the visit
- **Turning down a corner**: Different corners folded indicated different purposes (condolence, congratulation, departure from the city, etc.)
- **Reciprocity**: Receiving a card obligated a return visit or card
- **Introduction**: Cards were exchanged when being formally introduced
- **"p.p.c."** (pour prendre congé): Written on a card left when departing a town, excusing one from formal farewell visits

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_CARTE_DE_VISITE.0006 %%
Marie orders visiting cards for her mother (1873-09-11, "cent cartes de visite pour maman") as part of routine social maintenance. The visiting card system was central to the social world Marie navigated — it determined who could call on whom, tracked social obligations, and maintained the hierarchy of acquaintance. For a family like the Bashkirtseffs, who were wealthy but lacked established position in French society, the correct use of cartes de visite was essential for social integration.

## Photographic Cartes de Visite

%% GLO_CARTE_DE_VISITE.0008 %%
The photographic carte de visite — a small portrait photograph on card stock — was a craze of the 1860s-1870s. People collected albums of these photographs of friends, family, celebrities, and royalty. Marie references photographic portraits in this format, and the Bashkirtseffs had their photographs taken at studios like Nadar's.
