## Overview

%% GLO_GEORGE_SAND.0002 %%
George Sand (1804-1876) was the pen name of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, Baroness Dudevant, one of the most prolific and celebrated French novelists of the 19th century. Famous for her romantic novels (*Indiana*, *Lélia*, *Consuelo*, *La Mare au diable*), her male pseudonym, her habit of wearing men's clothing, her love affairs (with Alfred de Musset, Frédéric Chopin, and others), and her political activism, Sand embodied the possibility of a woman living an independent intellectual and creative life.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_GEORGE_SAND.0004 %%
George Sand serves as a complex point of reference for Marie. As a woman who achieved literary fame, financial independence, and public influence despite the constraints of her era, Sand represents the kind of success Marie craves. Yet Marie's ambition runs through visual art rather than literature, and she is drawn more to public recognition (Salon medals, critical acclaim) than to Sand's bohemian independence.

%% GLO_GEORGE_SAND.0005 %%
Marie read Sand's works and was aware of the biographical legends surrounding her. Sand died on June 8, 1876, during the period covered by Marie's diary, and the event may have prompted reflections on women's creative achievement and legacy.

## Historical Context

%% GLO_GEORGE_SAND.0007 %%
Sand published over 70 novels, numerous plays, and an autobiography (*Histoire de ma vie*). Her salon at Nohant was a meeting place for the cultural elite. Her influence on the idea of the "woman of genius" was enormous — she proved that a woman could sustain a professional literary career over decades and be taken seriously by the establishment.
