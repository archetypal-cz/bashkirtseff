*Paul et Virginie* (1788) is a novel by Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre that tells the tragic love story of two young people raised together on the island of Mauritius. The story became one of the most popular French novels of the 18th and 19th centuries, known for its simple yet deeply moving narrative.

The plot follows Paul and Virginie, childhood friends who grow up together in idyllic simplicity. When Virginie is sent to France for education, Paul remains on the island. The climactic tragedy occurs when Virginie's ship is wrecked in sight of shore during her return - Paul watches helplessly from a rock as the ship (a black dot on the horizon) carries her away to her death.

Marie is profoundly moved by this work, weeping repeatedly when reading it or hearing its opera adaptation. She particularly identifies with the irresistible emotional impact of the scene where Paul sees the ship as a black dot from atop the rock. She considers it "sublime" despite its simplicity, finding it more affecting than any dramatic novel.

**Cultural significance:**
- Exemplar of pre-Romantic sentimentality
- Critique of civilization's corruption versus natural virtue
- Immensely popular in 19th century France
- Adapted into opera by Rodolphe Kreutzer (1794) and others

**In Marie's life:**
When she first met Paul de Cassagnac, she ordered stationery from Duchod featuring Paul and Virginie under their leaf. Duchod mistakenly drew Virginie drowned - which Marie later saw as prophetic of her failed relationship with Cassagnac.
