# Niccolò de' Lapi

## Overview

Niccolò de' Lapi, ovvero i Palleschi e i Piagnoni is a historical novel by Massimo d'Azeglio, published in 1841. Set during the 1530 Siege of Florence, it follows an elderly silk merchant caught between rival Florentine factions — the Piagnoni (Savonarola nostalgists) and the Palleschi (Medici supporters).

## Relevance to Marie

On 1 October 1875, Marie's Italian companion Sabatini reads this novel to her on a bench on the Promenade des Anglais while she secretly observes Gioia's movements. The choice of Italian patriotic literature reflects Marie's Italian language studies and her cultural interests.

## Historical Context

D'Azeglio (1798-1866) was an Italian painter, novelist, and statesman who served as Prime Minister of Sardinia (1849-1852). His historical novels, including Ettore Fieramosca (1833) and Niccolò de' Lapi, were inspired by Walter Scott and aimed to awaken Italian national feeling against foreign domination.
