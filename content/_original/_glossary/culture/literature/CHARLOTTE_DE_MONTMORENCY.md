# Charlotte de Montmorency

## Overview

Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency (1594-1650), Princesse de Conde. A celebrated beauty of the early 17th century who was the last great passion of King Henri IV of France.

## Historical Context

Henri IV first noticed Charlotte at a ballet rehearsal at the Louvre on 16 January 1609, when she was not yet 15 years old. The king became infatuated and arranged her marriage to his cousin Henri II de Bourbon, Prince de Conde, expecting a compliant husband. Instead, Conde fled France with Charlotte after the wedding and did not return until after Henri IV's assassination in 1610.

The story of Henri IV appearing beneath Charlotte's window to admire her by candlelight was a famous episode in French historical culture, widely retold in memoirs, histories, and popular accounts. Marie would have known it from her reading.

## Relevance to Marie

On 17 October 1875 (carnet 047), Marie stages a deliberate reenactment: "Je veux faire comme Charlotte de Montmorency et Henri IV" — she takes two candles onto the balcony of the pavillon and poses between them, hoping to be seen by Lord Loftus ("Bibi") and Audiffret from their nearby windows. The scene escalates into wild excitement when a shadow appears at Loftus's window, with the girls dancing and performing on the balcony. Marie consciously models herself on the aristocratic beauty who captivated a king.
