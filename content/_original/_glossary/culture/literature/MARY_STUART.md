## Overview

%% GLO_MARY_STUART.0002 %%
Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (1542-1587), was one of the most dramatic figures in European history — a queen from infancy, briefly Queen of France, claimant to the English throne, and ultimately executed by her cousin Elizabeth I. Her story was a favorite subject of Romantic literature and drama, notably Schiller's play *Maria Stuart* (1800).

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_MARY_STUART.0004 %%
Marie identified with historical figures of grandeur and tragic destiny. Mary Stuart — beautiful, ambitious, multilingual, caught between political forces larger than herself — would have resonated with Marie's own sense of herself as destined for greatness but threatened by circumstances. The reference likely appears in the context of Marie's reading or historical reflections.
