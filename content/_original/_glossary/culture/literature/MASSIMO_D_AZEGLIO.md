## Overview

%% GLO_MASSIMO_D_AZEGLIO.0002 %%
Marchese Massimo Taparelli d'Azeglio (1798-1866) was an Italian statesman, novelist, and painter. He served as Prime Minister of Sardinia-Piedmont from 1849 to 1852, preceding Cavour. As a novelist, he is best known for *Ettore Fieramosca* (1833) and *Niccolò de' Lapi* (1841), both historical novels promoting Italian national consciousness during the Risorgimento.

## Relevance to Marie

%% GLO_MASSIMO_D_AZEGLIO.0004 %%
Marie's Italian companion Sabatini reads *Niccolò de' Lapi* aloud to her in October 1875 (carnet 045). The novel, set during the 1530 siege of Florence, is a patriotic tale of Italian resistance. While Sabatini reads, Marie secretly watches the movements of Gioia and Audiffret from her vantage point — the literary Italian patriotism serving as mere backdrop to her personal drama.

## Historical Context

%% GLO_MASSIMO_D_AZEGLIO.0006 %%
D'Azeglio was a quintessential figure of the Risorgimento: nobleman, artist, writer, and politician. His novels used medieval Italian settings to promote contemporary nationalist ideals. His marriage to Alessandro Manzoni's daughter connected him to Italy's greatest novelist. His famous quote "L'Italia è fatta. Restano da fare gli italiani" (Italy is made. Now we must make Italians) summarized the challenge of unification.
