# Isabel de Baviere

## Overview

*Isabel de Baviere* (also *Isabelle de Baviere*) is a historical novel by Alexandre Dumas, published in 1835 under the full title *Chroniques de France: Isabel de Baviere*. It is Dumas's first historical novel, set during the reign of the mad King Charles VI and the controversial Queen Isabeau of Bavaria.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie reads *Isabelle de Baviere* with Olga Sapogenikoff in October 1875. She finds it poorly written: "Isabelle de Baviere est si mal ecrite, les scenes si mal liees que c'est pitie" (046.0563). Despite the literary criticism, she persists in reading it, using it as a shared activity with Olga that she hopes will draw out the girl's romantic confidences.

## Historical Context

The novel was Dumas's first attempt at historical fiction, before the success of *The Three Musketeers* (1844). It covers the turbulent late 14th/early 15th century period of French civil war between the Armagnacs and Burgundians. The novel dramatizes scenes from Barante's *Histoire des Ducs de Bourgogne*.
