# Nadine Martinoff

**Research Status**: Moderate
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Book 00 (1884 preface)

## Identity

Nadine Martinoff was a young orphan adopted by [#Vassilissa_Babanine](Vassilissa_Babanine.md), Marie's great-aunt. She became the central figure in a calculated fortune-hunting scheme, marrying Marie's uncle [#Alexandre](Alexandre.md) at age 15½.

## Life Story

### The Adoption

Vassilissa Babanine, having become "maniaque et un peu ridicule" (obsessive and a bit ridiculous) in her later years, adopted the orphan girl Nadine Martinoff. The adoption appears to have been Vassilissa's attempt to create family and ensure care in her old age.

### The Abandonment

At age 14, Nadine:
- "S'est empressée de lâcher sa protectrice" (hastened to abandon her protector)
- Left Vassilissa to live at Grand-papa's estate at [#Tcherniakovka](Tcherniakovka.md)
- Was attracted by "plus de distractions" (more entertainments/distractions)
- Brought with her a fortune of about 20,000 rubles

### The Marriage Scheme

Once at Tcherniakovka:
- Uncle Alexandre, described as "très pratique" (very practical), "endoctrinated" her
- Marie notes parenthetically "(elle aussi)" - she too was practical
- They married as soon as she reached 15½ years old
- Formed "un couple excessivement rapace, cupide et heureux" (an excessively rapacious, greedy and happy couple)

## Family Reaction

Grand-papa was furious about the marriage, though Marie observes that "presque tous ses fils se sont mariés sans le lui dire" (almost all his sons married without telling him) - suggesting this was part of a pattern of sons defying parental authority.

## Marie's Characterization

Marie's description is devastatingly cynical:
- The parenthetical "(elle aussi)" suggesting Nadine was as calculating as Alexandre
- "Rapace" and "cupide" (rapacious and greedy) - ruthlessly money-focused
- "Heureux" (happy) - they were content in their mercenary partnership
- The phrase "s'est empressée" (hastened) suggesting eagerness to abandon her benefactor

## Historical and Social Context

Nadine's story reflects several aspects of 19th century Russian society:

**Orphan Vulnerability**: Orphans without family protection were entirely dependent on benefactors. Nadine's fortune of 20,000 rubles made her valuable.

**Early Marriage**: Marriage at 15½ was legal and not uncommon in 19th century Russia, especially for girls with dowries.

**Fortune Hunting**: The marriage between Nadine and Alexandre was transparently mercenary - he wanted her money, she wanted security and status.

**Generational Conflict**: Sons marrying without paternal permission was a recurring issue in aristocratic families, especially when money was involved.

## The Cruelty of Abandonment

Marie's narrative emphasizes the moral failing in Nadine's abandonment of Vassilissa:
- Vassilissa had given her a home and fortune
- Nadine repaid this by leaving her for "more distractions"
- After Grand-papa left, Nadine and Alexandre relegated Vassilissa to a miserable room where she died abandoned

The story illustrates how gratitude and loyalty could be displaced by self-interest and greed.

## Age at Key Events

## Marie's Moral Commentary

By including this story in her retrospective preface, Marie demonstrates her sharp eye for family hypocrisy and mercenary relationships. The tale of Nadine Martinoff serves as an example of how self-interest and greed operated within aristocratic families, with the young and vulnerable sometimes being as calculating as their predators.
