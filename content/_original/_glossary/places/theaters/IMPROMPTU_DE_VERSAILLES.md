*L'Impromptu de Versailles* (1663) is a one-act comedy by Molière, written as a response to critics of his earlier works. It's a meta-theatrical play in which Molière himself appears as a character, rehearsing his troupe for a performance before Louis XIV at Versailles.

The play satirizes Molière's rivals at the rival Hôtel de Bourgogne theater and defends his own theatrical style. It provides insights into 17th-century theatrical practices and Molière's views on acting.

Marie saw this performed at the Comédie-Française on October 27, 1880, as part of the bicentennial celebration of the Comédie. Coquelin played the role of Molière. Gambetta was present in a box opposite Marie's, having come specifically to see his friend Coquelin perform this role.

The play was performed along with *Le Bourgeois gentilhomme*, both with period-authentic music and staging - a special historical production for the anniversary celebration.

Marie notes wryly that this "Impromptu" was "a topical piece from two centuries ago" - the theatrical quarrels it satirized were 217 years old but apparently still resonated with current theatrical politics.
