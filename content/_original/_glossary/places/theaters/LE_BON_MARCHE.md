# Le Bon Marché

## Basic Information

Le Bon Marché was the first modern department store in Paris and a pioneering institution in retail history. Founded in 1838 as a small haberdashery by Aristide Boucicaut and his wife Marguerite, it underwent significant expansion in the early 1870s to become a revolutionary shopping destination. By 1873, when Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris, Le Bon Marché had recently been expanded with the help of Gustave Eiffel's engineering firm and featured 22 departments across multiple floors with wide, open interiors.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie mentions Le Bon Marché in her diary during her Paris visit in August 1873. Her cousin Dina suggested visiting the store, but Marie dismissed the idea, considering it beneath her social standing. Marie's diary entry notes that she considered shopping at Le Bon Marché as reflecting "vulgaire" tastes, which reveals her aristocratic aspirations and social snobbery.

This attitude toward department stores versus exclusive boutiques and fashion houses like Worth and Laferrière demonstrates Marie's preoccupation with social status and her desire to associate herself with the highest echelons of society. Despite the store's growing popularity and innovative retail concepts, Marie preferred the exclusive experience of haute couture establishments and specialized boutiques.

## Historical Context

Le Bon Marché revolutionized retail in the 19th century by introducing several innovations that define modern department stores:

- Fixed pricing (replacing the traditional haggling system)
- The ability to browse freely without obligation to buy
- A wide variety of goods under one roof
- Seasonal sales and special promotions
- Money-back guarantees
- Home delivery services

The store catered particularly to women of the growing middle class, offering them a respectable public space to shop independently. By the 1870s, Le Bon Marché had become not just a shopping destination but a social institution and tourist attraction.

The 1870s expansion, completed in 1872, transformed the store into an architectural marvel with iron and glass construction, grand staircases, and a light-filled central hall. The Boucicauts also introduced innovative employee benefits including profit-sharing, pension plans, free medical care, and educational opportunities for staff.

Marie's dismissal of Le Bon Marché reflects a common attitude among the aristocracy and those with aristocratic aspirations, who often viewed department stores as catering to the bourgeoisie despite the fact that these establishments were transforming consumer culture across all social classes.

## Later History

Le Bon Marché continued to thrive and expand in the decades following Marie's visit. In 1887, it moved to its current location on the Left Bank of Paris, in a building designed by Louis-Charles Boileau and Gustave Eiffel. The store survived both World Wars and remains in operation today as an upscale department store owned by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.
