## Overview

The Bois de Boulogne is a large public park on the western edge of Paris (16th arrondissement), covering 845 hectares. During Marie Bashkirtseff's time, it was the preeminent venue for fashionable Parisian society to see and be seen. Marie's daily carriage rides through the Bois were a central ritual of her social life in Paris, and the park appears throughout her diary as a backdrop for social observation, romantic longing, and displays of elegance.

## Historical Context

### Transformation Under Napoleon III
The Bois de Boulogne was transformed from a neglected royal hunting forest into a magnificent public park between 1852 and 1858, under the direction of Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. Inspired by London's Hyde Park (which Napoleon had admired during his exile in England), the park was redesigned with:
- Two artificial lakes (Lac Superieur and Lac Inferieur) with islands and grottoes
- Winding carriage paths and riding trails
- The Longchamp racecourse (opened 1857)
- Restaurants and cafes (Pre Catelan, Pavillon d'Armenonville)
- Cascading waterfalls and grottos
- The Jardin d'Acclimatation (1860)

### The Daily Promenade (1870s-1880s)
After the disruptions of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune, social life in the Bois resumed from 1872. Every afternoon, typically between 2:00 and 4:00 PM, the wealthy of Paris staged an elaborate promenade:
- Elegant carriages (caleches, victorias, landaus) circled the lakes
- Ladies displayed the latest fashions from Worth, Doucet, and other couturiers
- Gentlemen rode horseback alongside the carriages
- The parade was both a social ritual and a display of wealth and status
- Specific routes and stopping points were understood by all participants

### Racing at Longchamp
The Longchamp racecourse within the Bois hosted major racing events:
- The Grand Prix de Paris (established 1863)
- The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (established later, in 1920)
- Race days were major social occasions, drawing all of Parisian high society
- Marie attended races and observed the spectacle of fashion and competition
