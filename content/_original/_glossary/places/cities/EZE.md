Eze is a medieval hilltop village perched dramatically on a rocky peak 427 meters above the Mediterranean, located between Nice and Monaco on the French Riviera. In Marie Bashkirtseff's time, Eze was a picturesque destination for excursions from Nice, offering spectacular views of the coast and the Mediterranean. The village's narrow streets, old stone buildings, and strategic position made it a romantic and visually striking place.
