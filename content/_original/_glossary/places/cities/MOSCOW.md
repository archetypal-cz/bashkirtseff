## Overview

Moscow, the ancient capital and spiritual heart of Russia, appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as part of her Russian identity and family connections. While St. Petersburg was the political capital of the Russian Empire, Moscow retained enormous cultural and symbolic significance as the old capital, seat of the Orthodox Church, and center of Russian national identity. Marie's family, as Ukrainian-Russian nobility, had connections to both cities.
