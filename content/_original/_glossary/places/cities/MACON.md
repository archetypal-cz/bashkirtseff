## Overview

Mâcon is a city in eastern France in the Burgundy region, located on the Saône River. It served as an important stop on the railway line between Paris and the Mediterranean coast.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Mâcon was:
- A significant stop on the Paris-Lyon-Mediterranean (PLM) railway
- A wine-producing region (Mâconnais wines)
- Located approximately halfway between Paris and Lyon
- About 6-7 hours by train from Paris

## Marie's Journey - August 27, 1873

Marie mentions traveling with a French couple "avec nous jusqu'à Mâcon" (with us until Mâcon) during her overnight train journey from Paris to Nice on August 27-28, 1873.

The couple:
- Are French (not Russian or international like Marie's party)
- Are traveling to Switzerland
- Share the train compartment with Marie, her aunt, Dina, and Paul
- Part ways at Mâcon while Marie's group continues south

## Railway Context

Mâcon was a logical parting point:
- Travelers to Switzerland would change trains at Mâcon or continue to Geneva
- Those heading to the Mediterranean (like Marie) would continue on the PLM line through Lyon, Marseille, and on to Nice
- The Mâcon stop likely occurred during the night or early morning hours

## Weather During Journey

Marie notes that during this leg of the journey:
- A terrible storm ("orage éclate")
- Frightening lightning ("les éclairs sont terribles")
- Lightning strikes leaving silver lines in the sky for several seconds
- The dramatic weather marks the journey segment including Mâcon
