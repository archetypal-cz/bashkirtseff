Though only 74 km long, it is one of the most symbolically important rivers in Russian culture, as St. Petersburg was built on its banks and delta by Peter the Great. The Neva's wide, majestic flow through the city center, flanked by palaces, cathedrals, and government buildings, made it the defining feature of St. Petersburg's urban landscape.
