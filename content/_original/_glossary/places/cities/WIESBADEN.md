# Wiesbaden

## Overview

Wiesbaden is a city in Hessen, Germany, known since Roman times for its hot springs. In the 19th century it was a major European spa resort, attracting international aristocracy and high society. After the 1872 ban on gambling in the newly unified German Empire, the city -- like Baden-Baden -- lost much of its former glamour.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie visits Wiesbaden from nearby Schlangenbad in August 1875, noting the city's faded grandeur: "c'est un corps sans ame" (it's a body without a soul). She compares it favorably to Baden-Baden architecturally but notes the absence of fashionable society since the gambling ban. The city's Kursaal, Russian chapel, gardens, and horse races feature in her August 1875 entries. She also shops for a carriage and horses in Wiesbaden, without success.

## Historical Context

Wiesbaden had been part of the Duchy of Nassau until 1866 when it was annexed by Prussia. Its 26 thermal springs had made it one of Europe's premier health resorts. The Kursaal (assembly rooms), built 1804-1810, was the social center. Horse races were held regularly during the summer season.
