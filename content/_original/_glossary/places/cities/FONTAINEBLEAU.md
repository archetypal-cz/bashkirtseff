For Marie Bashkirtseff, Fontainebleau represented both a historical landmark and a popular excursion destination from Paris. The Chateau de Fontainebleau, with its centuries of royal art collections, and the surrounding forest, beloved by the Barbizon school of painters, made it a site of particular interest for an aspiring artist.
