## Overview

Algiers (French: Alger), the capital of French Algeria, was a Mediterranean port city that served as the administrative center of France's largest colonial possession. In Marie Bashkirtseff's time, Algiers was a growing city with a dual character: a European quarter (the Ville Nouvelle) built in the French style, and the old Casbah, the traditional Arab quarter perched on the hillside above the harbor.
