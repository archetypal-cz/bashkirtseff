## Overview

Florence, the capital of Tuscany, was one of the most important stops on Marie Bashkirtseff's Italian journeys. As the cradle of the Renaissance and home to some of the world's greatest art collections, Florence was an essential destination for any aspiring artist. Marie visited Florence during her 1876 Italian tour, which also included Rome and Naples, and the city made a strong impression on her developing artistic sensibilities.

## Historical Context (1870s)

### Post-Unification Florence
Florence had served as the capital of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy from 1865 to 1871, when the capital was transferred to Rome. This brief period of prominence had brought significant urban development:
- Demolition of the old city walls and creation of the viali (ring boulevards)
- Construction of the Piazzale Michelangelo (1869)
- Expansion of the city center
- However, the transfer of the capital left Florence in economic difficulty

### The Art Capital
Despite losing its political role, Florence remained Europe's preeminent city for the study of art history:
- **Uffizi Gallery**: One of the world's oldest and most famous art museums, housing works by Botticelli, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian, and Caravaggio
- **Palazzo Pitti**: The former royal palace with extensive collections
- **Accademia Gallery**: Home to Michelangelo's David
- **Churches**: Santa Croce, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, and the Duomo, all filled with masterpieces
- **Private collections**: Accessible to those with proper introductions

### Cultural Tourism
Florence in the 1870s was a major destination for the Grand Tour:
- Large foreign communities (British, American, Russian, German)
- Pensions and hotels catering to cultural tourists
- A circuit of museums, churches, and palaces that visitors were expected to follow
- Art schools and copying studios for aspiring artists
