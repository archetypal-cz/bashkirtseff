## Overview

Rome, the Eternal City and capital of the Kingdom of Italy since 1871, was a transformative destination in Marie Bashkirtseff's life. Her extended stay in Rome in 1876 marks a significant period in her development, during which the city of the Caesars and the Popes "acted upon her like strong wine" (as her biographer Mathilde Blind wrote). In Rome, Marie experienced artistic awakening, romantic adventure, and a deepening of her ambitions.

## Historical Context (1870s)

### Rome as New Capital
Rome had only recently become the capital of unified Italy:
- **1870**: Italian troops entered Rome after the withdrawal of French garrison troops during the Franco-Prussian War
- **1871**: Rome officially became the capital, replacing Florence
- **Papal reaction**: Pope Pius IX declared himself a "prisoner of the Vatican" and refused to recognize the Italian state
- **Urban transformation**: The new government embarked on massive construction projects to make Rome a worthy capital

### The Social World
Rome in the 1870s had distinct social spheres:
- **The "Black" aristocracy**: Noble families loyal to the Pope (Colonna, Orsini, Borghese)
- **The "White" aristocracy**: Families supporting the Italian state
- **The diplomatic corps**: Embassies and foreign representatives
- **The foreign colonies**: British, American, Russian, and German communities
- **The artistic community**: Painters, sculptors, and writers drawn by Rome's heritage

### Religious and Cultural Center
- **The Vatican**: Despite the political crisis, the Vatican remained a supreme cultural treasure
- **St. Peter's Basilica**: The center of Catholic Christendom
- **The Forum and Colosseum**: Classical ruins that drew scholars and tourists
- **The Campagna**: The wild, romantic countryside surrounding Rome

## Marie's Experience in Rome (1876)

### Artistic Encounters
Marie's encounter with Rome's art was characteristically independent and bold:
- She visited churches, palaces, museums, and galleries with passionate intensity
- She had a "refreshingly amusing and original fashion of seeing, admiring, and criticizing" the most celebrated masterpieces
- She took nothing on trust and was undaunted by great names
- She famously dismissed some of Raphael's work as "card-board painting" and described Titian's Venuses as "magnificent but stupid"
- She preferred naturalism and truthfulness in art over idealized traditions

### Romance
Rome was the setting for one of Marie's notable romantic episodes:
- She became involved with Pietro A____, a dark-eyed young Roman of twenty-three
- Pietro was the nephew of a powerful Cardinal
- Though he had no great career and was dependent on his family, he had charm
- The romance typified Marie's pattern of intense attraction followed by pragmatic assessment
- She was reluctant to let him go, but ultimately her ambitions took precedence

### Carnival
