# Rome

## Overview

Capital of the Kingdom of Italy since 1871. Marie visits Rome several times, most notably during the Carnival season of February 1876 (carnets 053-054).

## Relevance to Marie

Marie stays at the Hôtel de Londres during her Roman sojourn in early 1876. She is 17 years old and desperate to enter Roman high society, but the family's ongoing Russian lawsuit and scandalous reputation prevent them from receiving proper introductions. Rome becomes a stage for several romantic interests: Count Pietro Antonelli (nephew of Cardinal Antonelli), Count Vincenzo Bruschetti, and the aristocratic Doria. Marie attends the Roman Carnival, visits the Vatican, and frequents the fashionable promenades (Corso, Pincio, Villa Borghese).

## Historical Context

In 1876, Rome was still adjusting to its role as capital of unified Italy after the capture from papal control in 1870. The Pope (Pius IX) remained in the Vatican as the "prisoner of the Vatican," and Roman society was sharply divided between "black" (papal loyalist) and "white" (pro-Italian government) salons. The Carnival season was a major social event but was dampened by clerical opposition after 1870.
