## Overview

Naples, the great southern Italian port city on the Bay of Naples, figures in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary both as a potential refuge from Nice's social cruelties and as an actual destination during her Italian travels. Marie's 1877 visit to Naples during Carnival was particularly memorable, including her famous encounter with King Victor Emmanuel II. The city also appeared in earlier entries (1874) when the Bashkirtseff family considered relocating there after social setbacks in Nice.

## Historical Context (1870s)

### Post-Unification Naples
Naples had been the capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until Italian unification:
- **1860**: Garibaldi's expedition ended Bourbon rule
- **1861**: Naples was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy
- **1870s**: The city struggled with poverty and overcrowding despite its grandeur
- **Cholera epidemics**: Public health crises highlighted the contrast between elegant boulevards and teeming slums

### Winter Resort
Despite its social problems, Naples remained a major destination for European aristocracy:
- **Mild winter climate**: Similar appeal to Nice, attracting northern Europeans
- **Cultural attractions**: Ancient ruins, museums, churches
- **Bay of Naples**: Spectacular natural setting with Vesuvius as backdrop
- **Nearby excursions**: Pompeii, Herculaneum, Capri, Sorrento, Amalfi Coast
- **International society**: A seasonal colony of wealthy visitors

### Cultural Life
Naples in the 1870s offered:
- **San Carlo Opera House**: One of Europe's most prestigious opera venues
- **National Archaeological Museum**: Treasures from Pompeii and Herculaneum
- **Royal Palace**: The former Bourbon residence
- **Churches**: Hundreds of ornate churches with important artworks
- **Spaccanapoli**: The ancient heart of the city

## Marie's Relationship with Naples

### 1874: Imagined Refuge
After the Lewin ball invitation rejection (March 11, 1874), Marie and her mother discussed selling their Nice property (number 55) and fleeing to Naples. Marie wrote: "Nous avons parle de vendre 55 et nous en aller a Naples, car a Nice il n'y a plus de salut pour nous!" (We talked about selling 55 and going to Naples, for in Nice there is no salvation for us!). This dramatic reaction reveals:
- The depth of social humiliation the family felt in Nice
- Naples as representing an alternative social scene where they might start fresh
- The family's willingness to make radical changes to preserve social standing

### 1877: Carnival Visit
Marie visited Naples during Carnival in early 1877, accompanied by her mother, niece Dina, and Russian friends:
