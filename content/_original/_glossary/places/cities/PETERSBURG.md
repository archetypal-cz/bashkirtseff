I need write permission to update the glossary file. Could you approve the write so I can:

1. **Update `places/cities/PETERSBURG.md`** — clean up the entry (fix type from "people" to "places - cities", remove the duplicate stub header, fix relative paths in Related Entries)
2. **Delete `people/mentioned/PETERSBURG.md`** — it's an exact duplicate in the wrong category, with zero references pointing to it

The two files are byte-for-byte identical. All 16 diary references already point to `places/cities/PETERSBURG.md`.
