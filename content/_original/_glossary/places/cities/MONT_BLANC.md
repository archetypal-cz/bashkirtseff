## Overview

Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe, standing at 4,808 meters (15,774 feet). Located on the French-Italian border, it is one of the most iconic peaks in Europe and has been visible from Geneva since antiquity.

## Geographic Location

Mont Blanc is situated approximately 63 kilometers (in a straight line) from Geneva, Switzerland. The mountain marks the border between:
- France (Haute-Savoie department)
- Italy (Aosta Valley region)

## Visibility from Geneva

Mont Blanc is clearly visible from Geneva on clear days, making it a dramatic backdrop to the city:
- Visible from lakeside promenades, including the Quai du Mont-Blanc
- Visible from parks with views of the lake and mountains
- Best viewed from the summit of Mont Salève (above Geneva)
- The massif can be seen from many points between Geneva and Grenoble, and from Lyon to Dijon

Historical photographs from the 1870s confirm that Mont Blanc was a prominent feature of Geneva's landscape during Marie's time there.

## Historical Context (1870s)

During the 1870s, Mont Blanc was already a famous destination for:
- Alpine tourism and mountaineering
- Scientific expeditions
- Artistic inspiration (painters, writers, photographers)

The town of Chamonix at the base of Mont Blanc was established as a mountain resort, and the region attracted tourists from across Europe.

## In Marie's Diary

In Book 00, Marie describes her time in Geneva during the Franco-Prussian War (1870):

"A ce moment nous avions quitté l'hôtel de la Couronne pour loger dans une pension de famille, pension Huberkoller, et le Mont Blanc était en face de nous. J'ai donc copié scrupuleusement ce que je voyais de Genève et du lac" (At that moment we had left the hotel de la Couronne to lodge in a family boarding house, pension Huberkoller, and Mont Blanc was in front of us. So I scrupulously copied what I saw of Geneva and the lake)

This passage reveals:
- The Bashkirtseff family's pension had a direct view of Mont Blanc
- Young Marie was already drawing and practicing art
- Her drawing teacher encouraged her to draw from nature
- The dramatic Alpine scenery of Geneva made an impression on the young artist

## The Quai du Mont-Blanc, Geneva

The famous Quai du Mont-Blanc is a picturesque northern lakeshore promenade in Geneva featuring flowers, statues, and views of Mont Blanc on clear days. It leads past the Bains des Pâquis, where Genevans have enjoyed the lakefront since 1872—precisely during Marie's time in the city.

## Artistic Significance

Swiss photographer A. Garcin documented Mont Blanc and the Chamonix region during 1865-1875, the exact period when Marie was learning to draw in Geneva. His albumen silver prints captured the mountain's grandeur and are now preserved in collections like the J. Paul Getty Museum.

## Cultural Impact

For 19th-century travelers and expatriates in Geneva, Mont Blanc represented:
- The grandeur and beauty of the Alpine landscape
- A symbol of permanence and natural majesty
- Inspiration for artists, writers, and scientists
- A dramatic backdrop to daily life in Geneva
