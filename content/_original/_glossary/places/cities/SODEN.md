# Soden (Bad Soden am Taunus)

## Overview

Soden am Taunus (today Bad Soden am Taunus) is a German spa town in Hesse, nestled on the southern slopes of the Taunus mountains near Frankfurt. In the 19th century it was a fashionable health resort known for its mineral springs rich in carbonic acid and iron oxide, which were promoted for treating respiratory ailments. The town received the "Bad" (bath/spa) prefix only in 1922.

## The Kurhaus

The second Kurhaus was built between 1843 and 1849 in Swiss style by the Sodener Actiengesellschaft. It contained 15 bath cabinets, guest rooms, and a meeting hall. This is the building Marie describes staying at with her family during summer 1878.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie stayed at the Soden Kurhaus during summer 1878 (carnets 081-082), arriving in late June and departing on August 17. She was there ostensibly for a health cure related to her respiratory problems, but the stay became dominated by her social obsession with two German princes she nicknamed "Gans" (Goose) and "Schwarz" (Black). Dr. Thilenius, the local doctor, diagnosed her illness as more serious than French doctors had indicated.

The Kurhaus served as the social center where Marie orchestrated elaborate theatrical scenes, illuminations with Venetian lanterns, and strategic encounters with the princes. She departed at 5 AM on August 17, returning to Paris (67 avenue de l'Alma).

## Historical Context

Soden was near Homburg (Bad Homburg) and Frankfurt, both referenced in Marie's diary as places the princes and her companions traveled to. German spa towns like Soden were popular summer destinations for the European aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie in the 1870s-1880s.
