It looks like you haven't granted write permissions for the glossary directory yet. Could you approve the write so I can update the file? 

In the meantime, here's what the merge involves:

1. **Target** (`places/cities/SODEN.md`) — already well-researched. Only changes:
   - `last_updated` → `2026-02-10`
   - Added one line to "Relevance to Marie": *"Soden is also mentioned 3 times in Book 13 (1879), likely as a retrospective reference to the 1878 stay."*
   - Added to "References in Diary": *"Also mentioned: Book 13 (1879) - 3 mentions"*

2. **Source** (`people/mentioned/SODEN.md`) — a stub with no unique info beyond the Book 13/1879 mention count. No references point to it. Should be deleted after merge.

The source was miscategorized as `people/mentioned` (with type "Person/Place") when it's clearly a place. All its useful content (the 1879/Book 13 mentions) is incorporated into the target.
