# Schlangenbad

## Overview

Schlangenbad ("Snake Bath") is a small spa town in the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis district of Hessen, Germany, situated about 15 km north of Wiesbaden. Its thermal springs, discovered in the mid-17th century, maintain a constant temperature of about 30 degrees C and are rich in minerals.

## 19th Century Context

In the 1870s, Schlangenbad was a fashionable but quieter alternative to the grander spas like Baden-Baden or Wiesbaden. According to the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica, the town had eight thermal springs "mostly used for bathing, efficacious in nervous complaints and feminine disorders." It featured a "handsome kursaal connected with the principal bathing establishment." The permanent population was only about 400, with approximately 2,500 visitors annually -- a far cry from the glamorous crowds of Baden-Baden.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie and her family stayed at Schlangenbad during August 1875 (carnet 039) for a bathing cure. Marie found the place soporific ("Schlangenbad m'assoupit") and made regular excursions to the livelier Wiesbaden, about 90 minutes away by carriage. The family's bathing routine included morning baths at 8 a.m. and an early dinner at 1 p.m.
