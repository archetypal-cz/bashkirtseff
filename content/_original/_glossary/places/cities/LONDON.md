## Overview

London, the capital of the British Empire and the world's largest city in the 1870s-1880s, appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary primarily as the home base of various British aristocrats she encountered on the Riviera (notably the Duke of Hamilton), as a cultural reference point, and as a destination she visited. For Marie, London represented both the power of the British Empire and the social world from which many of the Riviera's most distinguished visitors came.

## Historical Context (1870s-1880s)

- **Industrial might**: Hub of global commerce and finance
- **Social extremes**: Vast wealth alongside terrible poverty (the world Dickens depicted)

### High Society
The London social season (roughly April through July) was the pinnacle of British aristocratic life:
- **The Season**: Presentation at court, balls, garden parties, Ascot, Henley
