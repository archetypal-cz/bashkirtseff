## Overview

The Vatican, the seat of the Catholic Church and residence of the Pope, was a site of both spiritual and artistic significance during Marie Bashkirtseff's Italian travels. In the 1870s, the Vatican was in the midst of a political crisis: the loss of the Papal States to unified Italy (1870) had left Pope Pius IX a self-declared "prisoner of the Vatican," creating a standoff between the papacy and the Italian state that would not be resolved until 1929.

## Historical Context (1870s-1880s)

- **Loss of temporal power**: Italian troops entered Rome in September 1870, ending over a thousand years of papal temporal sovereignty
- **Pius IX**: The Pope refused to recognize the Italian state, declaring himself a prisoner of the Vatican
- **The Roman Question**: The unresolved status of the papacy in Italy was a major diplomatic issue
- **Leo XIII**: Succeeded Pius IX in 1878, continuing the self-imposed confinement
- **Cultural treasures**: Despite the political crisis, the Vatican's museums and art remained accessible to visitors

### Art Collections
The Vatican held some of the world's greatest art:
- **Sistine Chapel**: Michelangelo's ceiling (1508-1512) and Last Judgment (1536-1541)
- **Raphael Rooms**: The frescoes of the Stanze di Raffaello
- **Vatican Museums**: Ancient sculpture, Egyptian antiquities, maps, tapestries
- **St. Peter's Basilica**: Michelangelo's dome and Pieta, Bernini's baldachin
