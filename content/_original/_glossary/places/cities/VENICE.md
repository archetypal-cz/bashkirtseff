## Overview

Venice, the floating city of canals and palaces, was among the Italian cities Marie Bashkirtseff visited during her European travels. Built on 118 small islands in the Adriatic Sea, Venice was in the 1870s both a living museum of artistic achievement and a city in gentle decline, having lost its political independence to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866. For Marie and her contemporaries, Venice represented the romance of the past and the supreme achievement of Venetian painting (Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese).

## Significance for Marie

### Artistic Education
Venice's painting was essential for any artist's education:
- The Venetian colorists (Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese) represented a tradition of painting that emphasized color and light
- Marie, who valued naturalism, would have found the Venetian approach to color and flesh both impressive and instructive
- The contrast with Florentine and Roman art (which emphasized drawing and form) was a classic artistic debate
