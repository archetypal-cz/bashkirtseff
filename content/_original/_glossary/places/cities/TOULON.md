## Overview

Toulon is a major port city on the Mediterranean coast in southeastern France. Marie passes through Toulon on August 28, 1873, during her train journey from Paris to Nice.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Toulon was:
- France's principal Mediterranean naval base
- A major commercial port
- An important stop on the Paris-Lyon-Mediterranean (PLM) railway line
- Still recovering from the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War and Paris Commune (1870-71)

## Geographical Position

Toulon is strategically located:
- On the Mediterranean coast, about 65km east of Marseille
- About 150km west of Nice
- Important waypoint on the coastal railway route

## Marie's Stop - August 28, 1873

During her overnight train journey from Paris to Nice:
- The train arrives in Toulon around dinner time (approximately 10:00 AM based on her comment)
- Marie and her companions have dinner at the station
- She finds the food "très bien" (very good)
- She wishes it were later (noon or 1:00 PM) so she could enjoy the meal more fully

Marie notes that from Toulon onward, she is "en proie à une grande douleur" (prey to great sorrow) because she is approaching Nice, which she abhors (in contrast to Paris, which she adores).

## Railway Travel Context

The Paris-Nice railway journey in 1873 typically took about 24 hours:
- Departed Paris evening/night
- Marseille reached early morning
- Toulon mid-morning
- Arrival in Nice late afternoon/evening

Stops like Toulon allowed passengers to have proper meals, stretch their legs, and break up the long journey.
