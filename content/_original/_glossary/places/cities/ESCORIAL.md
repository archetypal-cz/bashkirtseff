## Overview

El Escorial is the massive royal palace-monastery complex built by King Philip II of Spain (1563-1584), located about 45 km northwest of Madrid. One of the most imposing buildings in Europe, it served as a royal palace, monastery, basilica, library, and royal pantheon. For Marie Bashkirtseff, visiting El Escorial during the family's Spanish travels would have been an encounter with the austere grandeur of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty.
