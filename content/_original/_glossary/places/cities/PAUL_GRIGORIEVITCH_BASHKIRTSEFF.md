## Background

**Military Career:**
- Small nobility ("petite noblesse")
- Promoted to general rank after the Crimean War (1853-1856)

**Estate at Poltava:**

- Acquired it cheaply from ruined people (miners)
- Marie notes he showed much avarice and little generosity in this transaction
- The Poltava estate became the family's main property

## Character

Marie's description reveals a complex character:
- Military virtues: bravery, tenacity
- Hardness bordering on ferocity
- Shrewd in business dealings, even ruthless
- Marie's comment "C'est humain" (It's human) suggests she understood his self-interest as normal behavior

## Historical Context

Russian generals of the mid-19th century often came from the lesser nobility and built their fortunes through military service and strategic land acquisitions. The post-Crimean War period (late 1850s-1860s) saw many military men retiring to estates they had purchased with accumulated wealth.
