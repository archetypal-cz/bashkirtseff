## Identity

Odessa (modern Ukrainian: Одеса, Odesa; Russian: Одесса, Odessa) is a major port city on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine. In the 1870s, it was the Russian Empire's second most important port after St. Petersburg and one of its most cosmopolitan cities.

## Historical Context (1870s)

### Major Port and Commercial Center

Founded in 1794 by Empress Catherine the Great on land conquered from the Ottoman Empire, Odessa experienced rapid growth in the 19th century:

- **Railway Connection**: Construction of railways connecting Odessa with the hinterland in the 1860s-1870s accelerated development
- **Railway Arrival**: Railways came to Odessa in 1866, dramatically increasing its importance
- **Chief Export**: Grain was the principal export to Western Europe
- **Second Largest Port**: By this period, Odessa was Russia's second most important port
- **Population**: Toward the end of the 19th century, it became the fourth-largest city in the Russian Empire

### Cosmopolitan Character

> "Settled close to the fertile Ukrainian steppe, Odessa soon became the Russian Empire's chief exporter of cereals to western Europe. Attracted by trade and the liberal policies of its early governors, Greeks, Italians, Jews, French, Armenians, and other nationalities immigrated to the city and the surrounding countryside. By the late nineteenth century Odessa was the most polyglot and cosmopolitan city in the empire."

### Cultural and Social Hub

- **University**: Founded in 1865
- **Planned City**: Russian authorities regarded Odessa as the 'southern window to Europe' and paid great attention to its appearance
- **Noble Society**: Popular destination for Russian nobility
- **Hotels**: Major hotels catered to wealthy travelers and residents
- **Social Scene**: Active cultural life with theaters, concerts, and social gatherings

## In Marie's Diary (Book 00)

Marie describes Odessa as the location where her aunt's marriage to Romanoff was arranged (circa 1870):

> "On causait beaucoup du Romanoff, revenus à Odessa nous avons habité le même hôtel. Et un beau matin chacun se dit qu'il fallait en finir et que ma tante ne trouverait jamais un aussi beau parti."

("There was much talk of Romanoff, returned to Odessa we stayed at the same hotel. And one fine morning everyone said that it must be ended and that my aunt would never find such a good match.")

### Significance in Family History

Odessa served as:
- **Transit point**: Between Yalta (where they met Romanoff) and Tcherniakovka estate
- **Hotel society**: Place where aristocratic families stayed and socialized

- **Staging area**: Last stop before returning to family estate for the wedding
