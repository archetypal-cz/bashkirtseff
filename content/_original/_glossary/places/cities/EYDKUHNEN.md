## Basic Information

Eydkühnen (now Chernyshevskoye, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia) was a small Prussian border town on the Russian-German frontier. It served as the main railway crossing point between Germany and the Russian Empire.

Marie and her family passed through Eydkühnen in late July/early August 1876 en route to Russia, spending several days waiting at the Hôtel de Russie while Étienne traveled from Konotop.
