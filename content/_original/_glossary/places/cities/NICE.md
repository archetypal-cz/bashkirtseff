**Diary Coverage**: Throughout diary (1873-1884), most intensely 1873-1877

## Overview

Nice was Marie Bashkirtseff's primary home during the early years of her diary (1873-1877) and a recurring base throughout her life. A fashionable winter resort on the French Riviera, Nice had been annexed from the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860 and was rapidly becoming one of Europe's most prestigious destinations for aristocracy and wealthy families seeking the mild Mediterranean climate. The city's Russian colony was particularly prominent, maintaining strong ties to the imperial family.

## Marie's Residences in Nice

The Bashkirtseff family occupied several properties in Nice:
- **Villa Acquaviva** (51 Promenade des Anglais): Early residence, rented
- **Villa Romanoff** (55 bis): Subsequently acquired by the family, also referred to as "number 55" in the diary
- **Villa Bashkirtseff**: The family eventually had a property bearing their name
- Various other villas are mentioned, including Villa Peillon, Villa Gioia, and others during different periods

The family settled in Nice around 1871, joining the established Russian colony. However, as minor nobility, the Bashkirtseffs were not invited to the grandest receptions, a social exclusion that caused Marie significant distress.

## Locations in Nice Mentioned in the Diary

- **Promenade des Anglais**: The famous seafront where Marie walked daily, observed society, and hoped to encounter admirers
- **London House**: Upscale English confectionery and cafe, Marie's favorite haunt for hot chocolate and socializing
- **French Theater of Nice**: Where Marie frequently attended performances
- **Casino**: Social and entertainment center
- **Cercle Massena**: Exclusive social club

### Religious and Cultural Sites

### Natural Features

- **The surrounding hills and countryside**: Settings for excursions and carriage rides

## Social Life

The diary depicts Nice as having a seasonal social calendar, with "the season" (roughly November through April) bringing wealthy visitors from across Europe. Marie notes the difference between high season and off-season in terms of crowds, entertainment, and opportunities for social display.

### The Russian Colony
Nice had a substantial Russian community in the 1870s:
- Russian aristocratic families wintering on the Riviera
- Russian Orthodox church and social institutions
- Connections to the imperial court (though the Bashkirtseffs were peripheral)
- Russian-speaking social networks that provided both comfort and constraint

### International Society
The city attracted:
- **British visitors**: Large English-speaking community (hence "Promenade des Anglais")
- **Italian connections**: Proximity to the border, Italian cultural influence
- **Aristocracy from across Europe**: Dukes, princes, and noble families
- **Wealthy bourgeoisie**: Industrialists and financiers

## Historical Context (1860s-1880s)

### Recent Annexation
Nice had been ceded to France by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860 as part of the agreement following the Second Italian War of Independence. In Marie's time, the city was still adapting to French rule, with Italian cultural influences remaining strong.

### Urban Development
The 1870s saw Nice transforming from a quiet resort into a major European destination:
- Expansion of the Promenade des Anglais
- Construction of grand hotels and villas
- Railway connections making the city more accessible (the PLM line from Paris)
- Development of gardens and public spaces

### Climate and Health Tourism
Nice was primarily valued for:
- Mild winter climate (average January temperature around 10C)
- Believed health benefits for respiratory conditions
- Sea air and Mediterranean sunshine
- Escape from harsh northern European winters

## Marie's Relationship with Nice

Marie had a profoundly ambivalent relationship with Nice:

### What She Valued
- The beauty of the Mediterranean landscape
- The social scene during the season
- Proximity to Monaco and other Riviera attractions
- The freedom of the Promenade for observing society

### What Frustrated Her
- The provincial character compared to Paris
- Social exclusions (not receiving invitations to key events)
- Limited artistic opportunities
- The claustrophobic nature of the small Russian colony where gossip traveled fast
- The seasonal emptiness when fashionable visitors departed

### Nice vs. Paris
For Marie, Nice increasingly represented limitation while Paris represented possibility. Her eventual move to Paris (1877) to study art at the Academie Julian was experienced as a liberation from Nice's constraints. However, the family continued to return to Nice periodically, and it remained their primary property base.
