## Overview

The Academie de la Grande Chaumiere was a private art school in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris, located at 14bis rue de la Grande-Chaumiere. Founded in 1904, the academy in its later form postdates Marie Bashkirtseff's life. However, the street and the area around it were already associated with artists' studios and art education in Marie's era. If referenced in the diary, it may refer to another atelier or studio in the same area, or to the general artistic neighborhood of Montparnasse that preceded the formal academy.

## Historical Context

### Montparnasse as Art Quarter
The area around the Rue de la Grande-Chaumiere was an emerging artistic neighborhood:
- Located in the 6th arrondissement, near the Luxembourg Gardens
- Various private ateliers and art schools operated in the area
- Artists' studios were affordable compared to more fashionable districts
- The neighborhood would become the center of the Parisian art world in the early 20th century

### Art Education in Marie's Era
Paris offered multiple options for art training:
- **Academie Julian**: Where Marie primarily studied (Passage des Panoramas)
- **Ecole des Beaux-Arts**: The official state school (limited access for women)
