## Overview

Villa Souvoroff was a property in Nice, likely named after the famous Russian military commander Alexander Suvorov (1730-1800). The use of the name "Souvoroff" (the French transliteration of Suvorov) for a Nice villa reflects the strong Russian presence in the city. It may have been one of the properties occupied by the Bashkirtseff family or by members of their Russian social circle in Nice.

## Context

Many villas in Nice bore Russian names, reflecting the large Russian colony:
- Russian aristocratic families often named their properties after Russian historical figures
- The Russian community in Nice was substantial and well-established by the 1870s
- Properties changed hands and names as families came and went with the seasons
