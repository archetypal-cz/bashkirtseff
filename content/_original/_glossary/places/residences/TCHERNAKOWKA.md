## Overview

Tchernakowka (Chernakovka) was one of the Bashkirtseff family's properties in the Poltava region of Ukraine. The name suggests it may have been named after a dark feature of the landscape (from "chornyi" meaning black/dark in Ukrainian/Russian). As with other family estates, this property provided the agricultural income that supported the Bashkirtseff family's lavish lifestyle abroad.
