## Overview

Villa Gioia (Italian: "Joy") was a property in Nice referenced in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary. The Italian name reflects the mixed French-Italian culture of Nice, which had been part of the Kingdom of Sardinia until 1860. Many properties in Nice bore Italian names from the pre-annexation period. Villa Gioia may have been one of the Bashkirtseff family's residences or a property associated with their social circle.
