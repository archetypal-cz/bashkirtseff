**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1873-02-20

One of the prestigious hotels in Nice during the 1870s, and one of two hotels where Marie believed the Duke of Hamilton was staying during the winter season of 1873.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 20, 1873**: Marie learns that the Duke is staying either at the Hotel d'Angleterre or the Hotel de la Grande-Bretagne, based on information about Gioia visiting him there.

## Historical Context

The Hotel d'Angleterre was another of Nice's grand hotels catering to the British aristocracy and wealthy European visitors. Like the Hotel de la Grande-Bretagne, its name reflected the dominant British presence in Nice's winter resort society.

These hotels served as social hubs where aristocratic visitors would:
- Receive callers in their private suites
- Dine in elegant restaurants
- Attend social events
- Maintain the elaborate visiting and calling rituals that structured their social world

For a young woman like Marie, knowing which hotel a gentleman of interest was staying at was valuable social intelligence, even if social conventions prevented her from visiting or making direct contact.
