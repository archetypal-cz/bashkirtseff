A property or villa in Nice that the Bashkirtseff family visited and considered for residence in February 1873.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 19, 1873**: The family, accompanied by Biasini (likely a real estate agent or property manager), went to visit "Belmare." Marie's verdict: "c'est bien trop petit pour nous" (it's much too small for us).

## Historical Context

In 1873, the Bashkirtseff family was living at Villa Baquis (which Marie disdainfully called "Buffa"), a residence she considered beneath their social station. The visit to Belmare suggests the family was looking for better accommodations in Nice.

Marie's dismissal of Belmare as "too small" reveals:
- The family's need for a residence substantial enough to reflect their social ambitions
- Marie's acute sensitivity to how their address and living space affected their social standing
- The family's ongoing search for appropriate housing in Nice

The fact that they were viewing properties suggests either:
- Their lease at Villa Baquis was ending
- They were dissatisfied enough to consider moving mid-season
- They were planning ahead for the next winter season
