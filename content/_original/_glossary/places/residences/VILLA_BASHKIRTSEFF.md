## Overview

Villa Bashkirtseff was the family property in Nice that bore their name. The Bashkirtseff family occupied several properties in Nice during their years on the Riviera, beginning around 1871. The family first rented Villa Acquaviva at 51 Promenade des Anglais, then acquired the property at 55 bis, known as Villa Romanoff. The designation "Villa Bashkirtseff" may refer to the family renaming one of their acquired properties or to a later residence.

## Significance

The family's Nice residence was central to Marie's early diary years (1873-1877):
- The setting for daily life, family dramas, and social interactions
- The base from which Marie observed Nice society
- A symbol of the family's social status (or perceived lack thereof)
- The property Marie's mother discussed selling when social humiliations in Nice became unbearable (the "number 55" referenced in the 1874 Naples discussion)

## Context

The Bashkirtseff family's Nice properties reflected their position as minor Russian nobility on the Riviera:
- Wealthy enough to maintain villas, but not grand enough for the highest social circles
- Part of the Russian colony in Nice, but not connected to the imperial inner circle
- The villas served as both residence and stage for receiving visitors and social display
