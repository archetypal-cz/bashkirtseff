# Tcherniakovka

## Overview

Former Bashkirtseff family estate in the Poltava region of Ukraine. The name may derive from "chornyi" (black/dark in Ukrainian/Russian), suggesting a dark feature of the landscape. The suffix -ovka indicates a village or estate. The property was lost as part of the family's broader economic decline following the 1861 emancipation reforms, but continued to provide agricultural income that supported the Bashkirtseff family's lifestyle abroad.

## Relevance to Marie

Tcherniakovka carries dual significance for Marie:
- **Negative**: represents the provincial ways she rejects in her pursuit of Parisian sophistication
- **Nostalgic**: the lost family grandeur she never knew, romanticized through her father's stories
- **Economic**: part of the Ukrainian world she left as a child but which remained economically vital

## Context

- **Location**: Poltava governorate, Russian Empire (now Ukraine)
- **Purpose**: Agricultural estate providing income to the family
- **Management**: Run by stewards or family members while Marie's mother traveled Europe
