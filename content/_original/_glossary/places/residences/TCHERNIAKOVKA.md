It seems write permissions to the glossary aren't being approved. Would you like to grant write permission so I can:

1. **Update `places/residences/TCHERNIAKOVKA.md`** — replace the current "proposal text" with a proper merged glossary entry that documents all 5 diary references (the originals only had 2), with proper French accents, upgraded to "Standard" research status
2. **Delete `places/cities/TCHERNIAKOVKA.md`** — orphaned duplicate, wrong category
3. **Delete `people/mentioned/TCHERNIAKOVKA.md`** — orphaned duplicate, wrong category

The merged entry I prepared improves on both originals by:
- Documenting all 5 references (000-04, 000-05, 1873-03-03, 1874-04-13, 1874-04-23) vs. only 2 before
- Adding context from the preface entries (Nadine Martinoff's story)
- Including the 1873 Baba/nostalgia scene and the 1874 parrot-costume fantasy
- Fixing Related Entries paths to use relative `../../` format
- Adding Grand_papa, Alexandre, and Baba to related entries
- Upgrading coverage to "Up to 1874-04-23" and status to "Standard"
