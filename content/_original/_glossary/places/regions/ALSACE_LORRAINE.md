## Overview

Alsace-Lorraine (Elsass-Lothringen) was the territory annexed by the German Empire from France following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). The loss of these provinces was the defining national trauma of the early Third Republic, and references to Alsace-Lorraine in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary reflect the pervasive French sentiment of revanche (revenge) and national humiliation that colored political life throughout her years in France.

## Historical Context

### The Annexation
- **1871**: By the Treaty of Frankfurt, France ceded Alsace and the northern part of Lorraine to the new German Empire
- **Territory**: Approximately 14,500 square km with 1.6 million inhabitants
- **Cities lost**: Strasbourg, Metz, Mulhouse, Colmar
- **Cultural impact**: French-speaking populations now under German rule
- **The "lost provinces"**: Became a symbol of French national grief

### Impact on French Society
The loss of Alsace-Lorraine profoundly affected the France Marie inhabited:
- **Revanchism**: The desire to recover the provinces drove French foreign policy
- **National mourning**: The statue of Strasbourg on the Place de la Concorde was draped in black
- **Military buildup**: France rebuilt its military with recovery of the provinces as a goal
- **Political divisions**: The loss fueled both nationalism and republicanism
- **Cultural expression**: Literature, art, and public discourse constantly referenced the lost territories

### In Marie's World
For the political classes and fashionable society Marie observed:
- Alsace-Lorraine was a constant topic of political discussion
- Support for the "lost provinces" was a mark of patriotism
- The issue affected Franco-German relations and broader European diplomacy
