## Overview

Poland did not exist as an independent state during Marie Bashkirtseff's lifetime, having been partitioned among Russia, Austria, and Prussia in 1772-1795. However, Poland remained a powerful cultural and political concept. Polish émigrés formed significant communities in Paris and other Western cities, and the "Polish Question" was a recurring topic in European politics. Marie encountered Polish aristocrats and artists in the social circles of Nice and Paris.
