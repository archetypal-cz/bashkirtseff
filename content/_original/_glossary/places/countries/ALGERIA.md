## Overview

Algeria, France's largest colonial possession in North Africa, appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary in connection with travel, politics, and the broader French colonial world. Algeria had been under French control since 1830 and by Marie's time was considered an integral part of France (not merely a colony), with departments administered from Paris. The territory attracted European settlers, military personnel, and travelers drawn by the exotic landscape and warm climate.
