## Overview

Turkey, more precisely the Ottoman Empire, appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary primarily in political context. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 was a major event during Marie's diary years, and the "Eastern Question" (the fate of Ottoman territories in Europe) was a constant topic of diplomatic discussion. Marie, as both a Russian national and a resident of France, would have followed these events with particular interest.

## Historical Context (1870s-1880s)

- **Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)**: Russia fought Turkey, ostensibly to protect Slavic Christians in the Balkans
- **Treaty of San Stefano (1878)**: Russian victory, creation of a large Bulgaria
- **Congress of Berlin (1878)**: European powers revised the treaty, limiting Russian gains

## Significance for Marie
