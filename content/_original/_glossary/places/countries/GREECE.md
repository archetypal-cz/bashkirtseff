Greece appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary through cultural references to classical antiquity, political discussions about the Eastern Question, and the broader classical education that formed the foundation of 19th-century European culture. Modern Greece, independent from the Ottoman Empire since 1830, was in Marie's time a small, relatively poor kingdom whose significance was magnified by the immense prestige of ancient Greek civilization.
