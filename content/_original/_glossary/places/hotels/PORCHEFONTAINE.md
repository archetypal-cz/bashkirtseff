## Overview

Porchefontaine is a district in Versailles where horse races were held. Marie attends races there on Sunday, August 24, 1873.

## Historical Context

### The Racecourse

Porchefontaine had a racecourse from 1864 to 1870. Marie's reference to "courses à Porchefontaine" in August 1873 is historically interesting, as most records suggest the official racecourse was no longer active by this time. Possible explanations:
- Some racing activities continued informally after 1870
- The venue was used for other equestrian events
- Marie was mistaken about the exact location
- Local races at a smaller scale continued

### Post-War Context

The Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) and subsequent civil unrest disrupted many French institutions, including horse racing. By August 1873, racing was recovering but venues and schedules were still in flux.

## Marie's August 24, 1873 Visit

Marie considers it a "sacrilège" (sacrilege) not to attend these Sunday races. Her visit included:

### The Atmosphere
- Few carriages at the beginning, more arriving later
- Not many people overall compared to major races
- No elaborate toilettes (fashionable dresses) - "ce sont des courses simples"
- Not comparable to the prestigious May or October races at Longchamp
- Very close viewing position "tout à fait près de la corde" (right at the rail)

### The Races
- Multiple races with young horses (2-5 years old)
- One race specifically for two-year-old fillies
- Close enough to see the horses clearly as they passed
- Marie is completely absorbed, would not notice if someone were murdered in her carriage

### Social Aspects
- Marie, her aunt, Dina, and Bikowsky attend together
- They arrive by landau (open carriage)
- General enthusiasm among spectators - everyone shouting and gesticulating
- Marie loves that everyone is as passionate as she is about the racing

### Duke of Hamilton Connection
- Marie sees "sir David, duc de Hamilton" listed in the race program
- The Duke has only one horse entered (she notes he used to have five)
- Marie reads the Duke's name in the newspaper and carefully manages her reaction
- She doesn't see the Duke himself at the races, despite thinking she might

## Significance

This outing is Marie's first significant experience with French horse racing (as opposed to the disappointing Viennese races). She finds the French racing culture thrilling:
- Universal enthusiasm and passion
- Democratic participation (even coachmen passionately involved)
- Exciting atmosphere with shouting and cheering

Marie declares racing "ce qu'il y a au monde de plus amusant" (the most amusing thing in the world).
