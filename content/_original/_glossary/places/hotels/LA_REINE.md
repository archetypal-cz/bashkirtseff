## Overview

"La Reine" in Marie's diary refers to Queen Isabel II of Spain (1830-1904), the exiled Spanish monarch who maintained a prominent salon at the Palais de Castille (Palacio Castilla) in Paris. After her forced abdication in 1868 during the Glorious Revolution, Isabel II lived in exile in France for the rest of her life.

## Historical Background

### Reign and Exile
- **Born**: October 10, 1830, Madrid
- **Reign**: 1833-1868 as Queen of Spain
- **Exile began**: September 1868, fled to France after the Glorious Revolution
- **Abdication**: 1870, in favor of her son Alfonso XII
- **Died**: April 9, 1904, Paris

### The Palais de Castille

Isabel II's Parisian residence was the Palais de Castille (formerly Hôtel Basilewski) on Avenue Kléber, which served as:
- Center of the Spanish Bourbon exile community in Paris
- A legitimist/royalist salon attracting Bonapartists and royalists
- Site of political plotting for the Spanish restoration (successful in 1875)

The building is today The Peninsula Paris hotel.

## Relevance to Marie

Marie and her mother visited Queen Isabel II as part of their efforts to penetrate the most aristocratic circles of Paris. The May 1, 1882 visit was strategic - Marie notes in the margin that she went "chez la Reine dans l'espoir de rencontrer Cassagnac" (hoping to meet Cassagnac).

### Social Connections

The Queen's salon connected Marie to:
- Paul de Cassagnac (Bonapartist journalist Marie admired)
- Duchesses de Fitz-James (prominent legitimist family)
- Mme de Turenne
- Comtesse de Brye
- Other high aristocracy of Paris

### Social Significance

For the Bashkirtseff family, access to the Queen's salon represented:
- Entry into the most exclusive Parisian society
- Connection to royalist/Bonapartist political circles
- Validation of their social standing despite being foreign

## References in Diary

- **May 1, 1882**: First mention - visits with maman, hoping to meet Cassagnac
- **May 29, 1882**: Visits "à la Reine, aux deux duchesses de Fitz-Jame" as part of high society rounds

## Historical Note

Despite her political prominence, Isabel II "never learned to speak French properly" during her decades in Paris. She maintained close relationships with French legitimists and Bonapartists who shared her anti-Republican sentiments.
