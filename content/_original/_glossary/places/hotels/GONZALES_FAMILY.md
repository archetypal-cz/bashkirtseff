**Research Status**: Moderate
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Book 00 (1884 retrospective)

## Overview

The Gonzalès family was an Argentine family that Marie Bashkirtseff encountered in Baden-Baden around 1870. The family eventually became friends with the Bashkirtseffs despite initial misunderstandings involving romantic jealousy.

## Family Members

### Monsieur de Gonzalès ("le père Gonzalès")

Marie describes him as "République-argentinais Gonzalès" (Argentine Republican Gonzalès), suggesting he was involved in Argentine politics or diplomacy.

**Characteristics:**
- **Initially vain**: "Proud" of his perceived romantic conquests
- **Attracted to Marie's mother**: "Became in love with maman"
- **Eventually understanding**: After "harsh surprises" came to understand Marie's mother's genuine innocence
- **Long-term friend**: Despite complications, "became our friend"

**Social position**: As an Argentine official or diplomat frequenting Baden-Baden, he was part of the international elite circle at the spa resort.

### Madame de Gonzalès

**Characteristics:**
- **Jealous**: Became jealous of her husband's attention to Marie's mother
- **Cold and cutting**: Showed marked coldness ("très froide") to Marie's mother
- **Sharp-tongued**: Made pointed, sarcastic remarks

**Notable behavior**: At the train station when the family was departing Baden-Baden, she told Marie's mother "in a very pinched manner" that she was "confused to deprive maman of her walk in such beautiful weather" - a cutting remark that Marie recognized as hostile but her mother took as genuine concern.

### Rémy de Gonzalès Moreno

- **Age**: 13 years old (in Baden-Baden c. 1870)
- **Primary romantic interest**: Berthe Boyd (12)
- **Secondary interest**: Flirted with Marie ("me faire de l'œil")
- **Social connections**: Part of the aristocratic children's group

## The Comedy of Errors

Marie recounts an "almost incredible trait of naïveté" involving the adults:

1. **Monsieur's attraction**: Marie's mother, "free in her manner," inspired confidence in Monsieur de Gonzalès, who became attracted to her
2. **Wife's jealousy**: Madame de Gonzalès became jealous
3. **Mother's innocence**: Marie's mother befriended Madame de Gonzalès "in a frank, easy way" ("à la bonne franquette")
4. **Misreading signals**: Mother thought the wife must be as charming as the husband, who was so nice to her
5. **Doubled efforts**: When Madame showed coldness, mother "redoubled her amiability"
6. **Train station scene**: Even at the farewell, mother missed all the cutting remarks

Marie's retrospective comment: "When I think of it now, remembering the expressions and intonations, it's astounding."

## Marie's Sharp Observation

Even as a child (around 11-12 years old), Marie could read social situations her mother couldn't:
- She recognized Madame de Gonzalès's hostility
- She understood the subtext of the "pinched" remarks
- She saw her mother's naïveté for what it was
- She perceived the class dynamics at play

This early social intelligence would become one of Marie's defining characteristics.

## Evolution to Friendship

Despite the rocky start, the relationship evolved:
- Monsieur de Gonzalès initially attributed success to himself
- "Harsh surprises" taught him to understand Marie's mother
- He came to comprehend her genuine innocence and good nature
- The family "became our friend"

This suggests the Gonzalès family may have maintained contact with the Bashkirtseffs beyond Baden-Baden.

## Argentine Context

### Argentine Elite in 1870s Europe

The Gonzalès family represents the Argentine elite's participation in European high society during the 1870s. Many wealthy Argentine families:
- Sent diplomats and officials to Europe
- Frequented fashionable spa resorts
- Maintained cultural and social ties to Europe
- Often had European heritage or education

### "République-argentinais"

Marie's description "République-argentinais" may refer to:
- Argentina's republican form of government (as opposed to European monarchies)
- Monsieur de Gonzalès's political affiliation or position
- His role as representative of the Argentine Republic

## Significance in Marie's Development

The Gonzalès family episode taught young Marie:
1. **Social reading**: How to interpret subtext in conversations
2. **Gender dynamics**: The complications of male-female friendships
3. **Innocence vs. worldliness**: Her mother's naïveté versus her own awareness
4. **Class consciousness**: The importance of social connections
5. **Long-term relationships**: How initial misunderstandings can evolve into friendship

## Spelling Note

Marie writes "Gonzalès" (with grave accent on the 'e'), though "Gonzales" (without accent) is more common in Spanish. This may reflect:
- French phonetic spelling
- An actual family preference for the French spelling
- The family's European orientation
