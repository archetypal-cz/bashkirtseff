## Overview

The Jardin Public (Public Garden) of Nice was a park in the city center where Marie Bashkirtseff and her family would have walked and socialized. Nice's public gardens were part of the infrastructure of leisure that served the city's seasonal visitors, offering shaded promenades, flower displays, and spaces for social interaction away from the busier Promenade des Anglais.

## Context

Nice's green spaces in the 1870s served multiple purposes:
- **Social venue**: Places to walk, see friends, and be seen
- **Climate enjoyment**: Taking advantage of the mild Mediterranean weather
- **Health**: Fresh air and exercise, considered therapeutic
- **Musical performances**: Bandstands and concert areas in parks
