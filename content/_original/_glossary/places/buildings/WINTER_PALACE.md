## Overview

The Winter Palace (Zimniy Dvorets) in St. Petersburg was the official residence of the Russian Emperors from 1762 to 1917. Designed by Bartolomeo Rastrelli in the Russian Baroque style and completed in 1762, it was one of the grandest royal residences in Europe. For Marie Bashkirtseff, the Winter Palace represented the pinnacle of Russian imperial power and the social world to which her family aspired but could never fully access.
