## Overview

The Avenue des Champs-Elysees is the most famous avenue in Paris, stretching 1.9 km from the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe. In Marie Bashkirtseff's time, it was one of the city's principal promenades and a center of fashionable life, lined with grand private mansions (hotels particuliers), theaters, cafes, and gardens. Marie references the Champs-Elysees throughout her Paris diary as a setting for social life, promenades, and encounters.

## Historical Context (1870s-1880s)

### Post-Haussmann Development
By Marie's time, the Champs-Elysees had been transformed by Baron Haussmann's urban renovations:
- The avenue was widened and straightened during the Second Empire
- Architect Hittorff had redesigned the promenade gardens between 1836-1840
- Gas lighting illuminated the avenue (electric lights came later, in 1905)
- Elegant chestnut trees lined both sides

### Two Distinct Sections
The avenue had two characters:
- **Lower section** (Place de la Concorde to Rond-Point): Gardens, theaters, restaurants, and the Palais de l'Industrie (where the Salon exhibitions were held)
- **Upper section** (Rond-Point to Arc de Triomphe): Grand private mansions, embassies, and fashionable residences

### Key Establishments
In Marie's era, the Champs-Elysees featured:
- **Palais de l'Industrie**: Venue for the annual Salon art exhibition (until 1897)
- **Cirque d'Ete and Cirque d'Hiver**: Popular entertainment venues
- **Alcazar d'Ete**: Music hall and garden
- **Laurent**: Prestigious restaurant (opened 1842)
- **Ledoyen**: Another elegant restaurant dating from 1779
- **Jardin Mabille**: Dance hall and pleasure garden
