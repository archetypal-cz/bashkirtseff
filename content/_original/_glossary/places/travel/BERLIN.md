Berlin was the capital of the German Empire (1871-1918) and the Kingdom of Prussia. In Marie's time, it was one of Europe's major political and cultural capitals.

Gabriel Géry was reassigned from Rome to Berlin in late October 1880, working in the French diplomatic service. Marie notes "in any case, it's possible he'll remain a year at the ministry" - suggesting his Berlin posting might be delayed or abbreviated.

The reassignment reflects the fluidity of diplomatic postings during this period, particularly for junior diplomats like Gabriel who served at the pleasure of the ministry.

**Franco-German relations:**
In 1880, Franco-German relations were still tense following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. A posting to Berlin would have been politically sensitive but important for a French diplomat's career.
