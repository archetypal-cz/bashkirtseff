%% 2026-02-09T14:02:00 RSR: Empty entry. December 2 was the anniversary of Napoleon III's coup d'etat (1851) and of his coronation - a symbolically charged date for Bonapartists like those in Marie's circle. The silence may reflect either artistic absorption or emotional exhaustion following the Cassagnac disillusionment. %%
