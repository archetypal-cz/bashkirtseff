# Workflow Metrics

This directory contains quality metrics reports generated by the Executive Director.

## Report Structure

Each book has a metrics file: `book_XX_metrics.md`

Reports include:
- Agent performance statistics
- Quality score trends
- Issue category breakdowns
- Improvement suggestions

## Generating Reports

```bash
just workflow-report 15  # Generate report for Book 15
```

## Interpreting Metrics

### Agent Performance
- **Entities per entry**: Average entities found by Researcher
- **First-pass approval rate**: % of translations approved by Editor without revision
- **Average revision rounds**: How many times translations need rework
- **Final quality**: Average Conductor quality scores

### Trend Analysis
Watch for:
- Increasing first-pass approval (prompts improving)
- Decreasing revision rounds (translator learning)
- Consistent final quality (standards maintained)

### Actionable Insights
The ED will generate `improvement_suggestions.md` when patterns are detected.
Review these suggestions and apply approved changes to skill files.
