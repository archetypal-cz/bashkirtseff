Let me conduct the conductor review as specified.\n\n## Conductor Review: 1882-05-03\n\n### Pass 1: Holistic Reading (Translation Only)\n\nReading the Czech translation without reference to the original...\n\nThe Czech flows well as natural prose. Marie's personality comes through strongly - her dramatic self-criticism, her theatrical self-awareness, and her defiant resilience. The text has literary quality and feels like an authentic diary entry rather than a translation.\n\nKey observations:\n- \"Já, která jsem tolik slibovala!!\" - captures the dramatic, elliptical exclamation beautifully\n- \"Tak vida!\" - excellent colloquial Czech opener for \"Eh bien en voilà!\"\n- The theatrical metaphor of playing a role (\"hraji, a cítíc se před dobrým publikem\") reads naturally\n- Marie's complexity is preserved - the shift from crushing self-criticism to playful self-awareness\n\n### Pass 2: Comparative Analysis (Paragraph by Paragraph)\n\n**15.11** - Julian's harsh criticism is well rendered. \"Kopat, až se protrhnou\" captures the violent hyperbole. \"Třetí podzemí\" preserves the theatrical metaphor, though loses some of the specific stage terminology (\"dessous\" = theatrical understage). The red-hot pincers image is powerful. \"Zrůdnosti\" for \"infamies\" is correct in artistic context.\n\n**15.12** - Short and effective. Rhythm preserved.\n\n**15.13** - Good handling of the manuscript note. \"Snášet pravdu\" is natural Czech for \"entendre des vérités.\"\n\n**15.14** - The longest paragraph. Some nuances:\n- \"Tak vida!\" - excellent choice for \"Eh bien en voilà!\"\n- \"Fušovat\" for \"bâcler\" - perfect\n- \"Ženská práce\" - correctly gendered\n- \"Hluboce proniknu myšlenkou\" - slightly awkward; \"když se hluboce nechám prostoupit myšlenkou\" might be more natural, but the current version is acceptable\n- Triple \"nic, nic, vůbec nic\" - interesting choice to add \"vůbec\" for the third; maintains emphasis while slightly altering rhythm\n\n**15.15** - Julian's line rendered accurately.\n\n**15.16** - \"Nu což, je mi to tak milejší\" - nice rendering of the paradoxical acceptance. \"Vyjádřené co nejjasněji\" is slightly more matter-of-fact than \"réduits à leur plus nette expression\" but captures the meaning.\n\n**15.17** - The longest and most complex paragraph. Strong overall:\n- \"Vybřednu z toho\" - good for \"J'en sortirai\" (I'll get out of this)\n- \"Provdala bych\" - correct conditional\n- \"Nepovídám si s ním, hraji\" - excellent theatrical distinction\n- \"Dětských a rozmarných intonacích\" - captures \"enfantines et fantaisistes\"\n- \"Postava od Lefebvra\" - correctly identifies the artistic allusion\n- \"Cudných draperiích\" - preserves the classical artistic vocabulary\n\n**15.18** - Concise and effective. \"Podvádím\" captures \"je triche\" well.\n\n### Pass 3: \"Would Marie Approve?\" Test\n\nMarie would recognize herself in this translation:\n- Her dramatic self-criticism is preserved\n- Her theatrical self-awareness (\"I perform, I don't converse\") comes through\n- Her resilience (\"I'll get out of this\") is defiant\n- Her sophisticated artistic references are maintained\n- The gendered sting of \"travail de femme\" / \"ženská práce\" is preserved\n\n### Quality Scoring\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entry_date\": \"1882-05-03\",\n  \"verdict\": \"approve\",\n  \"quality_scores\": {\n    \"fidelity\": 0.90,\n    \"naturalness\": 0.88,\n    \"voice\": 0.92,\n    \"literary_quality\": 0.87\n  },\n  \"overall_quality\": 0.89,\n  \"verdict_comment\": \"APPROVED - Translation captures Marie's dramatic self-criticism and theatrical self-awareness with skill.
