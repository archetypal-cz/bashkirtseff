## Changelog

### 2026-02-04T10:50:26 @kerray
Initialized carnet README for progress tracking.

### 2026-02-09 @claude
Full extraction of carnet 087 from OCR raw text. 124 entries created (1879-12-22 to 1880-04-23), 895 paragraph IDs (087.0001-087.0895). OCR artifacts cleaned (page numbers removed, broken words joined, year spacing fixed). Paragraphs split across page boundaries rejoined where detectable. Duplicate April 14 header (empty) skipped. Previous 1880-01-02 entry was from a different source (wrong day-of-week, different text content); replaced with content from the raw OCR text. LAN annotations from old entry could not be preserved as they were for entirely different paragraph text.
