In August, Marie works on *La Parapluie.*

In October-November, Marie again visits Ukraine and again joins in a wolf hunt.

Back in Paris, Marie’s health worsens.

Friendship grows between Marie and Jules Bastien-Lepage, as well as with his brother Émile and their mother.

At year’s end, a doctor tells Marie that both lungs are affected and that she must leave Paris; she must go South. Again she refuses, staying in Paris to work on her art.

The closeness between Marie and her teachers, Julian and Tony, deepens; they attend dinner at her house.

On June 11, Marie’s father dies at Gavronzi; she reflects upon the often troubled relations between them and regrets not having traveled to Russia with her mother.

Mme Bashkirtseff returns to Paris from Gavronzi.

On June 18, Marie is interviewed by the correspondent of the Russian newspaper *New Times*. The article, which appears throughout Russia, will create, in Marie’s words, “a great stir.” Rosalie, Marie’s chambermaid, marries and Marie serves as maid of honor. The newlyweds come to live in the house and Rosalie continues in Marie’s employment.

Very ill, Marie begins *Le Meeting*.

During the summer she reads Tolstoy and Stendhal.

**1884**

In January, Marie visits the exhibition of the late Édouard Manet’s work.

The Union of Women Painters and Sculptors invites Marie to exhibit some of her work; this exhibit brings Marie further renown.

The symptoms of her illness grow worse.

*Le Meeting* is accepted at the Salon. Her painting is a success and attracts the attention of the public and the press. Many assume that the artist “M. Bashkirtseff” is a man.

Inquiries come in from newspapers, asking permission to engrave *Le Meeting*.

Marie works and reads; as her health declines, so too do her spirits.

In June, Marie receives an invitation to the Russian Embassy.

On June 28, Marie visits Jules Bastien-Lepage, who has returned very ill from Algeria.

Marie hopes to do a *plein air *painting of wrestlers.

One of Marie’s physicians, Dr. Potain, describes her as “the most undisciplined and imprudent invalid in the world.”

Marie’s intimacy with the Bastien-Lepages—Jules, Émile and their mother—increases, as do her admiration and her feelings for Jules.

She reads Tolstoy’s *War and Peace* and feels pride in being a Russian.

Even as she grows weaker, Marie protests her fate and continues to go out to sketch scenes she views from her carriage.

With the approach of autumn, Marie and Bastien-Lepage—both gravely ill—walk together in the Bois de Boulogne or visit each other at home.

Her fever increases and she cannot paint.

The brothers Bastien-Lepage begin visiting Marie, as she has visited Jules during his illness.

**1885**

In April, she is interred at Passy. During the course of the year, the stone mausoleum designed by Emile Bastien-Lepage is completed. “1860” is engraved on the stone wall as the year of her birth, thus perpetuating the falsehood begun during Marie’s earliest years.

The Society of Women Painters in Paris organizes a posthumous exhibition of works by Marie Bashkirtseff.

**1887**

The *Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff* is published in Paris under the direction of André Theuriet.  For over a century the bowdlerized Theuriet version of the *Journal* is reprinted may times and translated into many languages.

[^1]: We are indebted to Tatiana Shvets whose excellent chronology “Pages de la vie de Marie Bashkirtseff” has been an inspiration and a precursor of this one.

[^2]: Marie’s birth comes seven months after her parents’ marriage. The family celebrated her birthday on January 12, claiming that she had been born prematurely—part of a long-continued subterfuge by her family to conceal the truth—which she will learn from her father in 1878. After her death, “1860” will be engraved on the wall of her tomb as the year of her birth. This false date is also given in the Theuriet edition of the Journal.

[^3]: Thus begins the long Romanoff lawsuit, a protracted process started by Romanoff’s sister, who accuses the family of having entrapped her brother and of having poisoned him and falsified the will. Because of these rumors, they are excluded from Russian polite society in Nice.

[^4]: On March 9, after visiting the Howards, Marie writes: “The girls begged me to sing, and the other children did the same…. I sang ‘Santa Lucia,’ ‘The Sun is Risen,’ ‘I Am Only a Herd Girl,’ and some trills. They were so ecstatic that they all kissed me in awe! I sang not too badly. The grownups were in the other room listening, too. I didn’t know it at first, but when I realized it I continued singing. The children were full of surprise and respect for my voice. They predicted a glorious future for me and were in such ecstasies that Lise kissed my shoulder and then my hand. I can’t describe the excitement I inspired…”

[^5]: In April, Marie writes: “The most important sadness for Mama has been Paul. He was supposed to go with her and Dina to Genoa because two women cannot travel alone in Italy, but instead he ran away; and as we were leaving the station at Monte Carlo, we saw him going up the hill toward the Casino in a fiacre. I am sad to say that this unfortunate boy is completely lost. He disappears for entire days, coming home at last at 5:00 in the morning. He passes his time with thirty-year-old men, with actresses and even cocottes. At fourteen! Misery!”

[^6]: She learns the traditional subjects taught to boys in the lycée and sets herself an ambitious reading program: Homer, Plato, Plutarch, Herodotus, Livy, Epictetus, along with Dante, Shakespeare, Dumas, and Byron.

[^7]: June14: Marie and her family attend the Paris premier of Verdi’s *Requiem *: “What can I, poor little ignoramus, say about the *Requiem Mass?* I do not have the strength to criticize. It is very beautiful, extremely beautiful, admirable… Maybe I’ll be able to boast about it one day...to have heard Verdi’s Mass sung for the first time in Paris.”

[^8]: In November, Marie writes: “If you could know how I am boiling with anger inside! How tight my heart is! How many times tears come to my throat and suffocate me! Can anyone imagine a position like ours? It is this damned lawsuit—nothing else. But a lawsuit is not a crime. Why does everyone try to avoid us? Today when we passed by the quai Masséna, I felt one of the cruelest pains of my life: the two Seignettes snubbed Mama even though she had seen them many times at the Howards’. She looked at them, smiling, but they kept staring in front of themselves and did not look at us. Then Mama, fearing my reaction, wanted to hide her greeting, and continued her smile, as if she were looking into the store windows. I saw she was afraid of what I would say at this humiliation. She suffers more than I because she knows how I feel, and my suffering burns her like fire…”

[^9]: In April, Paul is sent back to Gavronzi to live with his father—and to separate him from the influences of Uncle George. After Paul’s arrival at their father’s house, Marie notes: “Nadinka writes that Paul was welcomed at his father’s house with salvos of cannons, champagne, etc., etc., and that they are preparing a magnificent apartment for him in the big house. The wretch will have his head turned all the way around. All this pomp makes me want to go there.”

[^10]: On December 4, Marie writes: “I announced that I am going to study singing and become an actress. And I will do it if God preserves my voice. It is the only way to acquire the fame I thirst for, for which I would give ten years of my life without hesitation. I cannot grow moldy, I need noise, renown, and glory! And I shall have them. *Deo juvante.*” [With God’s help.]

[^11]: She visits palaces and museums, admires paintings of the great masters, takes lessons from the painter Katorbinsky.

[^12]: Nephew of Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli, Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius IX.

[^13]: Marie wants Antonelli to declare his love, but it’s not clear that she either loves or would marry him.

[^14]: On their last night together, Antonelli asks her to marry him. Marie allows him to kiss her and joins in the kiss (as she will remember with shame).

[^15]: In July Marie visits M. Alexis, a somnambulist (fortuneteller), to question him about Pietro Antonelli; Alexis seems to make surprisingly accurate guesses. Of the visit, Marie writes, “Today I’ve seen some extraordinary things.”

[^16]: She travels to Russia via Berlin, visiting Saint Petersburg and Moscow, and joins her father at Gavronzi. She paints a portrait of her brother Paul, reads Pushkin and Gogol. At Poltava, she frequents theaters and poses in peasant costume in the studio of the photographer Khmelevsky.

[^17]: In early April, breaking convention and protocol, Marie approaches Vittorio Emanuele, King of Italy and speaks to him without introduction.

[^18]: August to September, Marie visits the thermal springs at Schlangenbad in search of a cure. She draws and paints in oils. Returning to France, she decides to move to Paris and devote herself to painting.

[^19]: Marie enrolls in the Académie Julian, a private atelier that accepts women, although they work in a studio segregated from the men. Teachers Rodolphe Julian and Tony Robert-Fleury note the rapid progress of their new student, praising and encouraging her talent.

[^20]: Marie writes, “For maybe the first time in my life I shed tears free from selfishness and anger. There’s something awful in the death of someone so thoroughly inoffensive and good.”

[^21]: Cassagnac marries an heiress, and Marie shifts her political allegiance.

[^22]: She learns that Soden is a health resort for consumptives, confirming her suspicions about her malady.

[^23]: Though praised by her teachers, Marie envies Breslau's talent. And yet, when her rival falls ill, Marie assists her.

[^24]: Marie resents the restrictions that women painters face. On January 2, she writes, “I long for the freedom to go out alone: to go, to come, to sit on a bench in the Jardins des Tuileries, and especially to go to the Luxembourg, to look at the decorated store windows, to enter churches and museums, and to stroll in the old streets in the evenings. This is what I envy. Without this freedom one cannot become a great artist. Can I profit from what I see when I’m accompanied or when I have to wait for my carriage, or my companion, or my family to go to the Louvre? It’s Hell! That’s when I rage about being a woman! As for me, I’ll try to set an example by showing society a woman who will have made her mark in spite of all her disadvantages.”

[^25]: Teachers Lefebvre, Boulanger and Robert-Fleury award her a medal; she is astonished and very proud.

[^26]: Saint-Marceaux finds it “well composed; it is right; it is good.” He emphasizes that her drawings are those of a sculptor.

[^27]: There is some dissension among his parents regarding this, but Marie fully supports her brother.

[^28]: After twenty years of separation, M. and Mme Bashkirtseff are somewhat reconciled.

[^29]: In October ,she writes, “I’m going to make a prediction: I’m going to die, but not suddenly…I’m going to drag on, with my colds, coughs, fevers, all sorts of things. I’m going to die as I have lived, horribly, in 4 years, maybe.”

[^30]: Visiting the Louvre, she studies the masterpieces, writing, “Before I saw and admired politely like the great majority of people. To feel that something is beautiful and understand why it’s beautiful—that is a great happiness.”

[^31]: She becomes acquainted with Hubertine Auclert, an advocate of Women’s Rights. On the day they meet, Marie introduces herself to Hubertine as “Pauline Orell.”

[^32]: She visits Madrid, Toledo, Còrdova, Seville, and Granada. She copies VelÁzquez in the Prado. She writes of his works, “All others pale before him.” On October 10, she notes, “As for painting, I’m on my way to learning a lot. I see what I didn’t see before. As my eyes are opened, I stand tiptoe, not daring to breathe, for fear the enchantment may cease...I seem finally to touch my dreams, seeing at last what I must do...”

[^33]: On November 6, she writes, “The lawsuit is over and we have won. That is to say, the inquiry shows that there never was a basis for the suit. It seems impossible; it’s been so long. But it’s true.”

[^34]: The right lung is fully infected; she suffers from pulmonary congestion, fever; deafness worsens. Concern for her mounts. She writes, “I refuse to give in. I get up and act like a normal person.”

[^35]: When Marie feels better, she works on a portrait of Nini and attends church to contradict rumors that she is “dying.”

[^36]: After years of feeling ostracized, Marie writes, “I’m dazed to realize all of a sudden that the dreams that have been accompanied by so many tears have come true… The dinner in our house has made our salon an aristocratic, artistic gathering place… if I were not afraid to break the charm, I would say that I am very happy.”

[^37]: Marie and Dina, Paul and Nini, as well as her maid Rosalie, all head for Nice; Marie’s mother and father soon follow. Marie feels renewed love for the city; she makes several sketches there. Following reports that the lawsuit in Russia was without cause, the family is more kindly received in Nice.

[^38]: In 1883 when Marie hears that Breslau is having difficulties, she writes, “Far from rejoicing over her misfortunes, I’m saddened by them. It wrings my heart; I’m moved even for unknown people, even for enemies. Because all injustice revolts me profoundly. She has lots of talent.”

[^39]: She writes, “Joseph of Arimathea has buried Jesus and the tomb has been sealed. As night falls, Mary and Mary Magdalene remain. It’s a sublime moment, not the least bit clichéd. Great simplicity, something awful, touching, and human.” She feels drawn to naturalism and wants to paint outdoors more; she works eight hours a day. She shows her sketch of *Les saintes femmes au tombeau* to Julian, who is very satisfied.

[^40]: Marie has an entire floor to herself, including a studio and balcony, as well as a garden that adjoins the house. She has now dedicated three years of her life to painting, but still doubts her talent.

[^41]: The painting shows “a little girl with her black skirts over her shoulders and an open umbrella.”

[^42]: The sons of Prince Sergé Kotchoubey, Basil and Victor, visit Gavronzi.

[^43]: She speaks with Dr. Duplay who tells her that her consumption is incurable. The deafness progresses and her vision becomes affected. Marie feels crippled and questions God’s mercy and intentions. On November 16 she writes, “I’ll never get well. It will be endurable, but there will always be a veil between me and the world.” Returning to the atelier, she works on.

[^44]: Émile and Jules Bastien-Lepage have planned the procession and decorations for the funeral.

[^45]: On January 27, she writes, “Bastien-Lepage is the greatest of the moderns.” In May, Marie writes to M. Davis in America asking if he wishes to sell Bastien-Lepage’s *Jeanne d’Arc.* Apparently, he does not because he eventually leaves it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

[^46]: On March 23, she writes, “I made my portrait this afternoon, life size, just to the hips, with the palette…” (*Autoportrait à la palette.*)

[^47]: She reflects that writing comes naturally to her and wonders if she should consider writing novels. On July 14 she writes, “This journal would be of prodigious interest after my death if I wrote a few good books.”

[^48]: She comments, “The whole of this exposition is striking…chaotic, infantile, and noble. With a little more he would be one of the geniuses of painting…such aplomb, such formidable confidence…like the childhood of a genius.”

[^49]: In March she writes, “For a few days there has been, I don’t know, some sort of fog around me...that cuts me off from the universe and makes me see the reality deep inside myself…What’s the use of anything? To fight and cry for 10 years, 6 of which were passed working 10 hours a day—to reach what? The beginning of talent and a mortal illness.”

[^50]: On March 31: “I took a hot bath for an hour and I was spitting blood…As long as one sinks to the bottom, it’s not death yet, but to touch the black and slimy bottom with one’s feet...To say to myself it’s not the fault of circumstances or my family or the world; it’s my *lack of talent.*”

[^51]: On May 12 Marie had written, “Everything I’ve been hearing about Jules [Bastien-Lepage] makes me think he has a cancer of the stomach.” Now she tells us, “He rose to receive us and took a few steps in the room. He seemed ashamed to appear so changed. So changed. I found him so changed that all I could say was, ‘Good. You have come back!’”

[^52]: On July 3 she writes, “I went to find some wrestlers on the boulevards in the company of Rosalie and Irma. Still nothing.” During July, she attends a wrestling match and delights in what she sees; however, she becomes discouraged when she discovers that wrestling is done indoors, during the evening, illuminated by artificial light; this destroys her concept of the painting.

[^53]: She remarks, “Each time I go [to Bastien's] I dress up as if for 100 people, and I even seem to have a good complexion because of my strong will.”

[^54]: On August 30: “The rage of seeing yourself die! The end of all my miseries! So many aspirations, so many desires, so many projects—to die at the age of 25, just at the beginning of everything. Whose fault is it? My family’s? Destiny’s? What have *I *done wrong?”

[^55]: On September 14, Marie writes, “I was like a rag, and Émile [Bastien-Lepage] carried me upstairs, followed by Dina. I don’t think I could have gone up by myself.”

[^56]: On October 16: “I can’t go out any more. But this poor Bastien comes to me. He has himself brought here, installed in an easy chair with his legs stretched out on cushions. I am in another chair very close by, and then we sit talking until 5 or 6:00… I was dressed in a cloud of lace and plush, all that in white, but several whites. Bastien’s eyes dilated with pleasure: “Oh, if I could paint!” he said. [Marie replied] “And I!”
