> published in *The Critic* 1890

> *The account of the funeral of Marie Bashkirtseff printed herewith was written by Mrs. Henry D. Paine of this city [New York], sent to a sister living in America, without any thought of ultimate publication. But so great an interest in the personality of the young Russian artist has been awakened by the publication of her Journal, that we have obtained the writer’s consent to the printing of her letter, which fortunately was not destroyed by the person to whom it was addressed.*

> *Paris, November 6, 1884*

Dear——: This morning we went to the Russian Church to the funeral of a young Russian girl of noble family who has endured herself to a large circle of friends in Paris. She was highly accomplished and as an artist of promise, her pictures having been admitted to the Salon. She was only twenty-three [sic: twenty-five] years old, and her early death is mourned by every one who knew or had heard of her. We were told that we must not fail to go to her funeral, as it would be a ceremonial of more than ordinary interest. We set out in good time, and as we were going along the Boulevard des Batignolles we came upon the cortege as it swept around the corner of an interesting street, thus gaining a complete view of it, and kept with it till it reached the church.

Leading the procession came a mourning coach in black and silver, the hammer-cloth elaborately embroidered in silver, and the coachman and footman black and white liveries with cocked hats. After this followed a platform on which stood the funeral casket, resting beneath a dome supported by four pillars. It was drawn by six white horses, their manes braided with black cords, and their rich housings of heavy white silk and cloth of silver reaching nearly to the ground. The platform and dome were covered also with white silk and cloth of silver, rich hangings falling from each pillar; and at the four points where they supported the dome was a tall black plume. A white pall, heavy with silver embroideries, covered the casket. Immediately after the funeral bier, and walking four abreast, were two men and two women. The prominent figure was that of a tall majestic woman, having on her right a distinguished-looking man of middle age, and on her left, a young man in evening dress. Both of the men were uncovered. On the right of the older man was another woman. Both the women were clad in rich mourning robes with very long trains, and their crêpe veils, draped from the crowns of their bonnets, dragged after their trains, both being weighted with the moisture of the damp street. After them followed at a slight distance about two hundred men and women, not walking in line, as is our custom, but an indiscriminate crowd of friends and relatives, as one sees in funeral processions in Paris. Behind the pedestrians were fifteen empty white coaches with white hammer-cloths and coachmen and footmen in white liveries. These were drawn by white horses. The first, I should say, was laden with flowers.

We found a large congregation awaiting the arrival of the body. The church was ablaze with innumerable wax candles burning in chandeliers, candelabras and wall brackets, though it was broad daylight. Under the great dome of the center of the church was erected a catafalque about fifteen feet high, which had the affect of being surmounted with a coffin covered by a white pall. At the base and on the line with the floor was a small square door, and through it was shoved the casket when it was brought into the church, and the door was closed. The structure was pyramidal in form, and covered with a bewildering and exquisite arrangement of plants, cut flowers, lights and draperies of white and silver while at each of the four corners a large brazier burned with an intense green flame. A priest in full canonicals assisted by two others in white robes, conducted the services. The voice of the principal celebrant was something phenomenal. It was like the bellowing a bull in its depth and resonance, but so thoroughly in its inflections as to be agreeable and musical withal. The choir, all of men, as is customary in Greek and Russo-Greek churches, responded in sweetest soulful tones, the contrast reminding one alternately of the wailing of the bereaved on earth and the rejoicing of the redeemed in Paradise. The description of the service would be that of the formula of the Russian Church on like occasions. I will not dwell upon it.

The day was mild. The countless lights in the church, together with the crowded congregation, made the heat almost unbearable. In addition to this, the custom of having no seats in Greek churches, where the people stand often for three hours during the worship, made the fatigue as well as the beauty of it all something to remember. We came away leaving the casket containing the body of the young girl amid the flowers and lights with which love had surrounded her, feeling that her freed spirit was now, as we trusted, satisfied—that the longings and yearnings she had not realized, the reachings after the unattainable to which the flesh was not equal, the problem of life which we had been told she had so early essayed to master, the cravings for the beautiful which seemed ever to elude, were now seen and understood.

> MARIE’S GRAVE

> *(The Pall Mall Gazette)*

Close to the entrance of the pretty, still, rural cemetery of Passy has Madame Bashkirtseff chosen to place the ‘chapel in Paris, surrounded by flowers, in a conspicuous place,’ dreamt of by Marie the year before her death. Usual as it is to see some object, dear to the dead who lie below, carefully preserved on their tombstones or set into the crosses erected above their graves—a wedding-veil or wreath, for instance—Mme. Bashkirtseff’s monument to her daughter’s memory provoked considerable comment at the time of its erection, and it is rarely that a day passes by without bringing one or two visitors to Marie Bashkirtseff’s last resting place, made by her mother’s loving hands more like a home than a grave.

The monument is divided into two parts—the basement or vault, and a chapel above. The latter, which can only be seen by the ordinary visitor through a glass door, has been fitted up like a corner of the studio we have just quitted. Her chair, little table, half dozen favorite books—there is something grotesquely horrible and yet pathetic in the sight. On the walls, inscribed in letters of gold, are the titles of her paintings, “Le Meeting,” now in the Luxembourg Gallery, “Spring,” etc. There, also, are the verses written by Coppée and several of his brother poets in remembrance of the young Russian girl who so loved France. A short flight of marble steps leads to the vault where stands the sarcophagus. A life-size, startling life-like portrait of Marie done in oils stands opposite the flower-covered bier, before which a light is always kept burning.

“When Mme Bashkirtseff is in Paris,” remarks the sacristan, “she spends much of her time here. They say this chapel cost as much as a villa—a hundred thousand francs—to build and arrange in this fashion. But then you see, it is the finest monument in Paris. Père Lachaise has nothing to show like it, nothing!” And he carefully takes us up again into the little half-chapel, half-boudoir above, and through into the free, fresh air of Passy once more.

[^1]: Mrs. Paine appears to have confused her Paris street names. Marie’s funeral departed her house at 30, rue Ampère, at half past ten and arrived at the Russian Church 12, Street Daru for the at eleven o’clock service; hence the cortege was never in the vicinity of Boulevard des Batignolles.
