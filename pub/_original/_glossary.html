<h1 id="acqua-viva">Acqua Viva</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Acqua Viva (meaning &ldquo;Living Water&rdquo; in Italian) was the Bashkirtseff family&rsquo;s former residence in Nice, which they had occupied before moving to the despised Villa Baquis in 1873. The villa represented everything that Villa Baquis was not - elegance, proper social standing, and respectability.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Acqua Viva held deep emotional significance for Marie:
- <strong>Symbol of Lost Status</strong>: Represented the family&rsquo;s former, more prestigious position in society
- <strong>Object of Nostalgia</strong>: Marie refers to it as &ldquo;notre chérie, bien-aimée, adorée Acqua Viva&rdquo; (our dear, beloved, adored Acqua Viva)
- <strong>Standard of Comparison</strong>: Everything at Villa Baquis was measured against the superior accommodations at Acqua Viva
- <strong>Source of Grief</strong>: The loss of this residence brought Marie to tears</p>
<p>The move from Acqua Viva to Villa Baquis represented more than just a change of address - it was a tangible sign of the family&rsquo;s declining fortunes and social position.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Villa names in Nice often reflected the romantic sensibilities of the era. &ldquo;Acqua Viva&rdquo; suggests a property with notable water features - perhaps fountains, a view of the sea, or proximity to one of Nice&rsquo;s streams. Such villas were typically located in the more fashionable districts and would have had proper reception rooms, gardens, and accommodations suitable for entertaining society.</p>

<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Comprehensive<br />
<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 2025-07-09<br />
<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to April 9, 1875  </p>
<h2 id="identity_4">Identity</h2>
<p>Alcibiades (c. 450-404 BCE) was an Athenian statesman, orator, and general during the Peloponnesian War. Known for his beauty, intelligence, and controversial character.</p>
<h2 id="maries-obsession">Marie&rsquo;s Obsession</h2>
<p>Marie declares herself &ldquo;in love&rdquo; with Alcibiades, calling him &ldquo;le grand, le beau Alcibiade&rdquo; and even adopting the persona &ldquo;Mme Alcibiade.&rdquo; She weeps over reading about him and claims she cannot love modern men because she&rsquo;s already in love with historical figures like him.</p>
<h2 id="historical-character">Historical Character</h2>
<p>Alcibiades was famously handsome, brilliant, and morally ambiguous. He was a student of Socrates but also known for his excesses and political betrayals. His complex character would appeal to Marie&rsquo;s romantic imagination.</p>
<h2 id="maries-romantic-ideal">Marie&rsquo;s Romantic Ideal</h2>
<p>For Marie, Alcibiades represents the type of great man she finds worthy of love - historically significant, beautiful, and dramatically flawed. She contrasts him with the &ldquo;canaille d&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui&rdquo; (today&rsquo;s scoundrels).</p>
<h2 id="literary-context">Literary Context</h2>
<p>Alcibiades appears in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues and various historical accounts. Marie&rsquo;s knowledge of him shows her classical education and her preference for dramatic historical figures.</p>
<h2 id="psychological-significance">Psychological Significance</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s &ldquo;love&rdquo; for Alcibiades represents her rejection of contemporary suitors in favor of impossible romantic ideals. It&rsquo;s both a sophisticated intellectual pose and a genuine expression of her romantic frustration.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-maries-development">Connection to Marie&rsquo;s Development</h2>
<p>At 16-17, Marie&rsquo;s infatuation with historical figures like Alcibiades reveals her intellectual precocity, her romantic idealism, and her sense of being above ordinary romantic attachments.</p>

<p>Alexander III of Macedon (356-323 BCE), known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.</p>
<h2 id="maries-emotional-response">Marie&rsquo;s Emotional Response</h2>
<p>Marie weeps while reading about Alexander&rsquo;s death, calling him a &ldquo;demi-dieu&rdquo; (demigod) and expressing frustration that &ldquo;so many scoundrels survived him.&rdquo; She opens the window and whistles for five minutes - her way of expressing great distress.</p>
<h2 id="historical-significance">Historical Significance</h2>
<p>Alexander conquered most of the known world by age 30, from Greece to India. His early death at 32 has been a source of historical fascination and tragedy.</p>
<h2 id="maries-romantic-idealization">Marie&rsquo;s Romantic Idealization</h2>
<p>For Marie, Alexander represents the pinnacle of masculine achievement and beauty. His youth and early death make him a romantic figure worthy of her tears and devotion.</p>
<h2 id="literary-context_1">Literary Context</h2>
<p>Alexander&rsquo;s story was well-known through classical sources and popular historical works. Marie&rsquo;s emotional response shows her deep engagement with historical narratives.</p>
<h2 id="psychological-pattern">Psychological Pattern</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s grief over Alexander&rsquo;s death, along with her similar reactions to Napoleon and other historical figures, reveals her pattern of investing emotionally in impossible romantic ideals.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-maries-character">Connection to Marie&rsquo;s Character</h2>
<p>Her passionate response to Alexander&rsquo;s death demonstrates her intensity, her preference for dramatic historical figures over contemporary men, and her capacity for deep emotional engagement with literature and history.</p>

<h2 id="identity_6">Identity</h2>
<p>Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) was a French novelist and playwright, author of classics such as &ldquo;The Three Musketeers&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo.&rdquo; He was one of the most popular French authors of the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id="maries-appreciation">Marie&rsquo;s Appreciation</h2>
<p>Marie defends Dumas against critics who &ldquo;despise&rdquo; him, arguing that a novelist&rsquo;s job is to entertain, and Dumas &ldquo;always amuses and often instructs.&rdquo; She reads his work &ldquo;Napoleon&rdquo; to her father, showing her genuine appreciation for popular literature.</p>
<h2 id="literary-context_2">Literary Context</h2>
<p>Dumas was often criticized by literary elites for his commercial success and popular appeal, but Marie appreciates his accessibility and entertainment value. This reveals her practical approach to literature - she values what engages and teaches.</p>
<h2 id="historical-significance_1">Historical Significance</h2>
<p>Dumas père was a prolific writer who helped establish the modern adventure novel. His works were widely read across Europe and reflected the Romantic movement&rsquo;s emphasis on emotion and adventure.</p>
<h2 id="maries-defense">Marie&rsquo;s Defense</h2>
<p>Her defense of Dumas in her diary entry from April 8, 1875, shows her independent literary judgment and willingness to go against intellectual snobbery. She asks: &ldquo;What do you ask of a novelist? To amuse.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="relevance-to-marie">Relevance to Marie</h2>
<p>Dumas&rsquo; adventure stories and historical novels likely appealed to Marie&rsquo;s romantic imagination and her love of dramatic narratives, much like her own life aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="religious-context">Religious Context</h2>
<p>The Anglican Church (Church of England) was the established Protestant church of England. Many British residents in Nice would have attended Anglican services.</p>
<h2 id="maries-attendance">Marie&rsquo;s Attendance</h2>
<p>On April 11, 1875, Marie attends Anglican service with Collignon and Dina. She expresses deep appreciation for English prayers, saying &ldquo;Rien de plus comme j&rsquo;aime que les prières anglaises.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="maries-religious-sentiment">Marie&rsquo;s Religious Sentiment</h2>
<p>Marie declares herself Protestant &ldquo;de cœur&rdquo; (at heart) while waiting to become a declared Protestant. She finds the Anglican liturgy particularly moving and meaningful.</p>
<h2 id="prayer-for-royalty">Prayer for Royalty</h2>
<p>During the service, Marie notes the prayers for the Prince of Wales (Albert Edward), the Queen, and the nobility. She turns the page three times during these prayers and reflects on how prayer makes them &ldquo;adorable.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="maries-spiritual-development">Marie&rsquo;s Spiritual Development</h2>
<p>Her attraction to Anglicanism seems connected to her anglophilia and her romantic fascination with British aristocracy. The formal liturgy and prayers for royal figures appeal to her sensibilities.</p>
<h2 id="social-context">Social Context</h2>

<h2 id="connection-to-maries-character_1">Connection to Marie&rsquo;s Character</h2>

<h2 id="baden_baden"><a href="../Baden_Baden.md">Baden_Baden</a></h2>
<h1 id="baden-baden">Baden-Baden</h1>
<h2 id="overview_8">Overview</h2>
<p>Baden-Baden is a spa town located in southwestern Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. During the 19th century, it was one of Europe&rsquo;s most fashionable and prestigious resort destinations, earning the nickname &ldquo;Summer Capital of Europe.&rdquo; The town was particularly popular among European aristocracy, including Russian nobility, and was known for its thermal baths, casino, and cultural attractions.</p>
<h2 id="historical-development">Historical Development</h2>
<p>Baden-Baden&rsquo;s history as a spa destination dates back to Roman times, but it reached its zenith during the 19th century. Key developments during this period included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The redesign of the <em>Kurhaus</em> (1821-1824) into an elegant casino and social hub</li>
<li>The completion of the <em>Trinkhalle</em> (Pump Room) in 1842</li>
<li>The construction of the monumental Friedrichsbad bathhouse (1869-1877), which combined luxurious bathing with modern facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The city&rsquo;s architecture was heavily influenced by Belle Époque aesthetics, with grand hotels, villas, and cultural institutions designed to appeal to elite tastes. Designers from Paris helped transform Baden-Baden into a refined cultural retreat resembling the opulence of French cities like Monte Carlo.</p>
<h2 id="social-and-cultural-significance">Social and Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>Baden-Baden became a central meeting place for Europe&rsquo;s elite during the 19th century. Its attractions included:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thermal Baths</strong>: The town&rsquo;s natural hot springs were believed to have healing properties and attracted visitors seeking health treatments</li>
<li><strong>Casino</strong>: The elegant gambling establishment was a major draw for wealthy visitors</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Venues</strong>: Theaters and concert halls hosted performances by renowned artists</li>
<li><strong>Lichtentaler Allee</strong>: This landscaped park bordered many grand hotels and became a frequent promenade for high society</li>
<li><strong>Horse Racing</strong>: The racecourse attracted aristocratic spectators and participants</li>
</ol>
<p>Notable visitors to Baden-Baden included Queen Victoria, Napoleon III, Fyodor Dostoevsky (who famously gambled in its casino, experiences that influenced his novel <em>The Gambler</em>), Johannes Brahms, and numerous members of Russian nobility.</p>
<h2 id="mention-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-diary">Mention in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Diary</h2>
<p>In Marie&rsquo;s February 6, 1873 diary entry, she mentions Baden-Baden when describing a tribune (viewing stand) at a shooting competition in Monaco: &ldquo;La tribune m&rsquo;a rappelé celle de Bade et celle de Nice&rdquo; (The tribune reminded me of the one in Baden and the one in Nice).</p>
<p>This reference suggests that Marie had previously visited Baden-Baden, likely during her family&rsquo;s travels throughout Europe before settling in Nice. Her comparison of the viewing stands indicates her familiarity with the social venues of multiple European resort destinations.</p>

<p>The Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) and the 1872 ban on gambling in the newly unified German Empire led to a decline in Baden-Baden&rsquo;s fortunes. The city subsequently shifted focus back to its roots as a balneological (therapeutic bathing) center.</p>
<p>For Russian aristocrats like the Bashkirtseff family, Baden-Baden represented one of several Western European destinations where Russian nobility established seasonal residences and participated in international high society. The town was particularly popular with Russian visitors, who were attracted by its elegant atmosphere, gambling opportunities, and health facilities.</p>

<h1 id="bensa_1">Bensa</h1>
<h2 id="overview_9">Overview</h2>
<p>Bensa was one of Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s teachers in Nice during 1873. Based on diary entries, he appears to have been responsible for arranging other professors for Marie&rsquo;s extensive educational program and also taught her directly.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_1">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie first mentions Bensa in her September 1873 diary entries. In the September 9 entry (not yet processed), she refers to him as &ldquo;one of Marie&rsquo;s teachers who arranges for other professors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the September 17, 1873 entry, Marie describes an amusing interaction with Bensa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mais quelle <em>riaille</em> [sic] nous eûmes avec Bensa ! Ce pauvre homme est si drôle ! Dina et moi nous amusons à ne pas le comprendre ou bien lorsqu&rsquo;il raconte des choses extraordinaires ne pas nous étonner ou encore nier ce qu&rsquo;on a dit et prouver qu&rsquo;il fait nuit à midi. Quelque temps il discute, mais enfin il commence à danser, secouer ses mains et ne pousse que des soupirs et des espèces de gémissements: - Ah ! Mlle Dina ! ah ! Mlle Marie !&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage reveals that Marie and her cousin Dina would tease Bensa by pretending not to understand him, refusing to be impressed by his &ldquo;extraordinary things,&rdquo; and arguing absurdities like &ldquo;proving it&rsquo;s night at noon.&rdquo; Bensa&rsquo;s exasperated reaction - dancing, shaking his hands, and sighing &ldquo;Ah! Mlle Dina! ah! Mlle Marie!&rdquo; - shows how they successfully provoked him.</p>
<p>In the same entry, Marie mentions trying to convince Bensa that &ldquo;the head of Nero is more beautiful than that of Apollo,&rdquo; suggesting that he may have been teaching her about classical art or history.</p>
<p>In the September 19 entry, Marie mentions that Bensa had commented on Gioia&rsquo;s hair: &ldquo;Bensa en a parlé: j&rsquo;ai vu cette bel/eu [sic] dame avec de beaux cheveux&rdquo; (Bensa spoke of it: I saw this beautiful lady with beautiful hair).</p>
<h2 id="character-and-role">Character and Role</h2>
<p>Based on Marie&rsquo;s descriptions, Bensa appears to have been:</p>
<ol>
<li>A somewhat excitable or emotional teacher who could be easily provoked by his students&rsquo; teasing</li>
<li>Someone who arranged for other professors in Marie&rsquo;s educational program</li>
<li>Possibly a teacher of art, history, or classical studies</li>
<li>Someone who moved in Nice society and was familiar with figures like Gioia</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s playful interactions with him suggest she felt comfortable enough to tease him, indicating a less formal teacher-student relationship than might have been typical for the time.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_7">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s, young women of Marie&rsquo;s social class would typically receive education from private tutors rather than attending schools. Marie&rsquo;s educational program was unusually extensive for a young woman of her time, including multiple languages, sciences, music, and art. Teachers like Bensa would have been hired by wealthy families to provide this private education.</p>

<h2 id="overview_10">Overview</h2>
<p>Berthe appears in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as a potential romantic rival, particularly in connection with the Duke of Hamilton. She is mentioned during the crucial period of summer and fall 1873 when Marie is obsessed with Hamilton.</p>
<h2 id="key-appearances">Key Appearances</h2>
<h3 id="september-1-1873">September 1, 1873</h3>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s mother mentions: &ldquo;Et comment Berthe a dit que Hamilton l&rsquo;épousera absolument&rdquo; (And how Berthe said that Hamilton will absolutely marry her). This claim devastates Marie and intensifies her jealousy and anxiety about Hamilton&rsquo;s romantic interests.</p>
<h3 id="the-boyd-connection">The Boyd Connection</h3>
<p>There are references to &ldquo;Boyd et Berthe&rdquo; suggesting Berthe may be connected to the Boyd family, possibly as Berthe Boyd. The Boyd family appears to be part of the English or Scottish expatriate community in Nice.</p>
<h2 id="role-in-maries-emotional-life">Role in Marie&rsquo;s Emotional Life</h2>
<p>Berthe represents:
- <strong>A Romantic Threat</strong>: Someone who claims Hamilton will marry her
- <strong>Social Competition</strong>: Part of the same social circles competing for eligible men
- <strong>Source of Anxiety</strong>: Her claims about Hamilton cause Marie significant distress</p>
<h2 id="social-context_2">Social Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s Nice winter season, young women of marriageable age from wealthy families competed for the attention of eligible bachelors. The Duke of Hamilton, as one of the wealthiest and most titled young men, was the ultimate prize. Berthe&rsquo;s confident claims about marrying him would have been seen as either:
- Based on real encouragement from Hamilton
- Bold social maneuvering
- Wishful thinking</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-other-figures_1">Relationship to Other Figures</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duke of Hamilton</strong>: Object of her matrimonial ambitions</li>
<li><strong>Boyd Family</strong>: Possibly related or connected</li>
<li><strong>Marie Bashkirtseff</strong>: Rival for Hamilton&rsquo;s affections</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="historical-note">Historical Note</h2>
<p>The competition between young women for eligible men in 19th century high society was intense and often cruel. Public claims about engagements or promises of marriage were serious matters that could damage reputations if proven false.</p>

<li>Is Berthe&rsquo;s last name Boyd?</li>

<h1 id="boreel_1">Boreel</h1>
<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Comprehensive
<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 2025-06-28
<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to 1873-02-17 (being updated)</p>
<h2 id="identity-and-background">Identity and Background</h2>
<p>Alfred Boreel, frequently mentioned in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary, was a young man she regularly encountered during the winter social season in Nice in 1873. Based on Marie&rsquo;s descriptions, he appears to have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>A handsome young man of European aristocratic or wealthy background</li>
<li>Possibly Dutch, though Marie notes confusion about his nationality</li>
<li>Part of the international social scene in Nice</li>
<li>Not as wealthy or high-ranking as the Duke of Hamilton, Marie&rsquo;s primary romantic interest</li>
</ul>
<p>Marie initially believed him to be &ldquo;Baron Finot&rdquo; before learning his actual identity, causing her some disappointment as she valued titles highly.</p>
<h2 id="physical-appearance-and-characteristics">Physical Appearance and Characteristics</h2>
<p>Marie provides detailed descriptions of Boreel throughout her diary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Described as &ldquo;very beautiful&rdquo; and &ldquo;superb&rdquo;</li>
<li>Had &ldquo;good gray eyes&rdquo; and a &ldquo;naive face that did not lack beauty&rdquo;</li>
<li>Marie notes his &ldquo;coarse&rdquo; ungloved hand, which she found appealing</li>
<li>Had a mustache he would pull when displeased</li>
<li>Marie criticizes his gait/walk as &ldquo;ignoble&rdquo; in a later marginal note</li>
<li>Dressed elegantly and rode horses</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="social-activities_3">Social Activities</h2>
<p>Boreel participated in the typical activities of wealthy visitors to Nice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily appearances on the Promenade des Anglais, often on horseback or in a carriage</li>
<li>Attendance at balls and social events (appeared as a &ldquo;bandit&rdquo; at Carnival balls)</li>
<li>Directed the cotillion at a ball at the Cercle Masséna</li>
<li>Visits to Monaco, which Marie views negatively</li>
<li>Participation in the carnival cavalcade</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maries-relationship-with-boreel">Marie&rsquo;s Relationship with Boreel</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s feelings toward Boreel fluctuate dramatically throughout her diary:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Attraction</strong>: She admits to being attracted to him and blushing when he looks at her</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Thinking</strong>: She uses her apparent interest in Boreel to disguise her feelings for the Duke</li>
<li><strong>Disappointment</strong>: She expresses disappointment upon learning he is not a baron</li>
<li><strong>Criticism</strong>: She criticizes his behavior, particularly his visits to Monaco and alleged drinking</li>
<li><strong>Renewed Interest</strong>: She admits to missing seeing him when he appears less frequently</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: She constantly compares him unfavorably to the Duke of Hamilton</li>
<li><strong>Later Dismissal</strong>: In marginal notes added later, she dismisses her interest in him as childish</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie and Boreel never have a direct conversation in these diary entries. Their interaction is limited to exchanged glances, his greetings to her mother, and Marie throwing flowers to him during carnival.</p>
<h2 id="confusion-about-identity">Confusion About Identity</h2>
<p>Marie records several conflicting accounts of Boreel&rsquo;s background:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initially believed to be &ldquo;Baron Finot&rdquo;</li>
<li>Identified as &ldquo;M. Boreel, American&rdquo;</li>
<li>Later as &ldquo;M. Boreel, Dutch&rdquo;</li>
<li>Finally as &ldquo;M. Boreel, Prussian&rdquo; (though Marie doubts this)</li>
</ol>
<p>This confusion reflects both the international character of Nice&rsquo;s winter visitors and possibly Boreel&rsquo;s own ambiguity about his origins.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_10">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The presence of young men like Boreel in Nice during the winter season was typical of the international social scene of the French Riviera in the 1870s. Wealthy families from across Europe would spend the winter months in the mild Mediterranean climate, creating a cosmopolitan social environment.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s preoccupation with Boreel&rsquo;s title (or lack thereof) reflects the class consciousness and social hierarchies of European society in this period. Her disappointment upon learning he is not a baron reveals her social ambitions and the importance she placed on aristocratic status.</p>
<h2 id="maries-later-perspective">Marie&rsquo;s Later Perspective</h2>
<p>In marginal notes added to her diary in 1874, Marie is often critical of her earlier interest in Boreel:</p>
<ul>
<li>She calls her writings about him &ldquo;detestable and stupid&rdquo;</li>
<li>Refers to him as &ldquo;this grotesque figure&rdquo; when comparing him to Hamilton</li>
<li>Dismisses him as &ldquo;a clumsy little joke&rdquo; and &ldquo;not a gentleman&rdquo;</li>
<li>Notes that her interest in him had already ended &ldquo;since the summer&rdquo; before the winter season described</li>
</ul>
<p>These later comments suggest Marie&rsquo;s embarrassment about her youthful infatuation and her desire to distance herself from these feelings.</p>

<h1 id="comte-de-mulinare-chevalier-edouard-de-moelenar">Comte de Mulinare (Chevalier Edouard de Moelenar)</h1>
<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Basic
<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 2025-07-04
<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to 1874-08-31</p>
<h2 id="identity_64">Identity</h2>
<p>The Comte de Mulinare, whose name Marie also spells as &ldquo;Chevalier Edouard de Moelenar,&rdquo; was a Belgian aristocrat who became the subject of Marie&rsquo;s mockery during her stay in Ostende in August 1874. He represents the first real-life example of what Marie calls a &ldquo;Plobster&rdquo; - her code word for men who attract attention but whom she finds ridiculous rather than genuinely attractive.</p>
<h2 id="the-original-plobster">The Original &ldquo;Plobster&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Marie first notices him posing constantly around the social venues of Ostende, particularly at the Kursaal. She describes him as having:
- A long nose under a small &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo; hat
- Excessive posing &ldquo;to the point of ridicule&rdquo;
- A resemblance to a lobster (homard in French)
- Tall stature</p>
<h2 id="social-interactions">Social Interactions</h2>
<p>After about fifteen days of mutual observation and his constant posing, he was finally introduced to Marie&rsquo;s party on August 29, 1874, by Basilévitch. The introduction revealed his full name as &ldquo;Chevalier Edouard de Moelenar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During their conversation, he spoke about Marie&rsquo;s boots and feet, but she noted that &ldquo;his language lacks polish&rdquo; and concluded he was &ldquo;not a real Plobster&rdquo; - meaning he lacked the genuine aristocratic refinement she valued.</p>
<h2 id="maries-treatment">Marie&rsquo;s Treatment</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s attitude toward the Comte was one of amused contempt:
- She laughed uncontrollably whenever she saw him
- She compared his movements to Paparigopoulos (another figure she found ridiculous)
- She made him &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; in her circle as an object of mockery
- She called him &ldquo;ce beau chevalier errant&rdquo; (this handsome knight errant) sarcastically</p>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>The Comte de Mulinare/Moelenar represents an important development in Marie&rsquo;s social observations. While she had previously used &ldquo;Plobster&rdquo; to describe attractive men she admired from afar, this usage shows the term evolving to include men who try too hard to attract attention but fail to meet her exacting standards of aristocratic behavior and refinement.</p>
<p>His appearance in the diary also demonstrates Marie&rsquo;s cruel wit and her tendency to make entertainment out of those she considered social inferiors or pretenders.</p>

<h2 id="historical-context_17">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The most prominent Count Arnim of this period was likely Harry Karl Kurt Eduard von Arnim-Suckow (1824-1881), a Prussian diplomat who served as German ambassador to France (1871-1874). His tenure was marked by conflicts with Chancellor Bismarck.</p>
<h2 id="diplomatic-significance">Diplomatic Significance</h2>
<p>If this is the diplomat Arnim, his friendship with &ldquo;the prince&rdquo; (likely a Russian or other European royal in Nice) would have been politically noteworthy, given the complex diplomatic relationships following the Franco-Prussian War.</p>
<h2 id="social-standing">Social Standing</h2>
<p>Count Arnim&rsquo;s mention in Nice society gossip indicates he was either present on the Riviera or his reputation and connections were significant enough to be discussed among the international elite.</p>

<h1 id="dina-babanina">Dina Babanina</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_2">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Dina Babanina (also spelled Babanin) was Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s cousin and a significant figure in her life. She appears in Marie&rsquo;s diary as a close companion and is also depicted in several of Marie&rsquo;s artworks.</p>
<h2 id="family-background">Family Background</h2>
<p>Dina came from a somewhat tumultuous household compared to Marie. Her parents&rsquo; marriage was annulled, which rendered Dina and her brother illegitimate according to the social standards of the time. This background contrasted with Marie&rsquo;s more stable and refined environment, though both were part of the same extended family.</p>
<p>Dina was related to Marie through the Babanina family line, which was Marie&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s maiden name (Maria Stepanovna Babanina).</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-marie_1">Relationship with Marie</h2>
<p>Despite their different circumstances, Dina and Marie shared a close, lifelong bond. They traveled together with Marie&rsquo;s mother and participated in social events, as evidenced by Marie&rsquo;s January 30, 1873 diary entry: &ldquo;Maman et Dina sont à une matinée musicale à l&rsquo;hôtel Chauvain, au profit d&rsquo;un pauvre Russe&rdquo; (Mother and Dina are at a musical matinee at the Chauvain hotel, for the benefit of a poor Russian).</p>
<p>Their relationship extended beyond family ties to include intellectual companionship. In Marie&rsquo;s final days, as her health deteriorated from tuberculosis, Dina stayed by her side, reading novels to her and offering comfort during her illness.</p>
<h2 id="appearances-in-maries-art">Appearances in Marie&rsquo;s Art</h2>
<p>Marie depicted Dina in multiple artworks, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>A pastel portrait titled <em>Dina Babanine</em> completed in 1883</li>
<li><em>The Reader</em> (also known as <em>La Liseuse</em>), a painting where Dina appears as a thoughtful young woman reading a serious and controversial book</li>
</ol>
<p>These artistic depictions reflect both their personal relationship and Marie&rsquo;s broader interest in portraying women engaged in intellectual pursuits. <em>The Reader</em> in particular conveys both intelligence and the role of women in society, aligning with Marie&rsquo;s advocacy for female independence and equality.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_18">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The relationship between Marie and Dina provides insight into family dynamics among the Russian aristocracy living abroad in the late 19th century. Despite differences in their social standing, their close bond demonstrates how extended family connections remained important within expatriate communities.</p>
<p>Dina&rsquo;s presence in Marie&rsquo;s life and art also reflects the importance of female companionship and solidarity in an era when women&rsquo;s opportunities were limited. Their intellectual camaraderie suggests a shared interest in literature and ideas that transcended the conventional expectations for young women of their time.</p>

<h2 id="document_humain"><a href="../Document_Humain.md">Document_Humain</a></h2>
<h1 id="document-humain">Document Humain</h1>
<h2 id="overview_15">Overview</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Document Humain&rdquo; (Human Document) is a literary concept that became particularly significant in late 19th century French literature, especially in naturalist and realist movements. The term refers to authentic, unfiltered human experiences and emotions documented in a way that reveals psychological and social truths.</p>
<h2 id="literary-context_3">Literary Context</h2>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;document humain&rdquo; was popularized by the Goncourt brothers (Edmond and Jules) and later championed by Émile Zola as part of the naturalist literary movement. It represented a shift away from romanticism toward a more scientific, observational approach to human behavior and society.</p>
<p>Writers who embraced this concept sought to:
1. Record human experiences with clinical precision
2. Document the psychological, physiological, and social aspects of human behavior
3. Present unvarnished truths about human nature and society
4. Use personal observations and experiences as source material for literature</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-diary">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Diary</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary itself is considered a prime example of a &ldquo;document humain.&rdquo; Her unflinching self-analysis, detailed observations of her emotions, and candid documentation of her thoughts exemplify the concept.</p>
<p>When Marie uses the hashtag #Document_Humain in her diary, she is typically marking passages that:
1. Reveal particularly raw or authentic emotions
2. Document her unfiltered psychological states
3. Record socially significant or revealing moments
4. Capture experiences that might serve as material for understanding human nature</p>
<p>For example, in her January 12, 1873 entry, she uses this tag when describing her fortune-telling ritual and her fantasies about becoming the Duchess of Hamilton. This represents a candid documentation of her romantic aspirations and psychological state.</p>
<p>Similarly, in her January 13 entry, she uses the tag when describing her dream about seeking an introduction to the Duke of Hamilton, again documenting her authentic desires and social ambitions.</p>
<p>In her January 19 entry, the tag appears when she describes her physical reactions to seeing the Duke (foot-tapping, blushing) and her governess&rsquo;s reprimand, capturing a moment of genuine emotional vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="historical-significance_2">Historical Significance</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s use of this concept connects her diary to the broader literary movements of her time. Though she began her diary before the term was widely popularized, her approach aligns perfectly with the naturalist emphasis on psychological truth and social observation.</p>
<p>The fact that Marie was aware of and using this concept suggests her literary sophistication and her connection to contemporary intellectual currents, despite her young age when beginning the diary.</p>
<p>Her diary would later be celebrated precisely for its quality as a &ldquo;document humain,&rdquo; offering insights into the psychology of a young woman coming of age in late 19th century European high society.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-maries-artistic-development">Connection to Marie&rsquo;s Artistic Development</h2>
<p>As Marie later developed her artistic ambitions, this concept would have resonated with her approach to painting as well. The naturalist emphasis on observing and documenting reality without idealization parallels many of the developments in late 19th century painting, particularly in the realist and naturalist movements.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diary, with its emphasis on psychological truth and detailed observation, foreshadows her later artistic sensibilities and her desire to capture authentic human experiences in her art.</p>

<h2 id="identity-and-background_1">Identity and Background</h2>
<p>The Duke of Hamilton mentioned in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary is likely William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845-1895). He was a Scottish nobleman who held multiple titles including:</p>
<ul>
<li>12th Duke of Hamilton</li>
<li>9th Duke of Brandon</li>
<li>2nd Duke of Châtellerault (French peerage)</li>
<li>Hereditary Keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hamilton family was one of the most prestigious in Scotland, with royal connections dating back centuries. Their seat was Hamilton Palace in Lanarkshire, Scotland, which Marie references in her March 8, 1873 entry when she finds information about &ldquo;the beautiful castle of the Duke of Hamilton&rdquo; in Bouillet&rsquo;s dictionary.</p>
<h2 id="wealth-and-lifestyle">Wealth and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Marie repeatedly refers to the Duke&rsquo;s immense wealth and aristocratic lifestyle. In her diary, she mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>His yacht (March 4, 1873)</li>
<li>His participation in pigeon shooting competitions</li>
<li>His elegant appearance and noble bearing</li>
<li>His residence at either the Hotel de la Grande-Bretagne or Hotel d&rsquo;Angleterre in Nice</li>
</ul>
<p>The Duke was indeed known for his extravagant lifestyle. The Hamilton family was among the wealthiest in Britain, with extensive landholdings and valuable art collections. The Duke was a noted sportsman and yachtsman, consistent with Marie&rsquo;s descriptions.</p>

<p>In Marie&rsquo;s diary, the Duke is frequently associated with a woman named Gioia, whom Marie envies and resents. The identity of this woman is unclear from historical records, but she may have been:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mistress or romantic interest</li>
<li>A society woman in Nice</li>
<li>Possibly Lady Mary Montagu, whom the Duke married in 1873</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie suggests that the Duke&rsquo;s relationship with Gioia is not based on genuine love but rather on convenience, writing on March 4, 1873: &ldquo;I believe he doesn&rsquo;t love her, but he prefers to be free, to have a wife since it&rsquo;s necessary for chic, horses, a wife, pigeon shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_20">Historical Context</h2>
<p>During the 1870s, Nice was a popular winter resort for European aristocracy and wealthy families, particularly British and Russian. The presence of figures like the Duke of Hamilton was common during the winter social season.</p>
<p>The Duke&rsquo;s participation in activities like pigeon shooting competitions was typical of aristocratic leisure pursuits of the era. These competitions were major social events that attracted the elite from across Europe.</p>
<h2 id="maries-obsession_1">Marie&rsquo;s Obsession</h2>
<p>The Duke becomes the primary object of Marie&rsquo;s romantic fantasies throughout her diary. Her fixation on him reveals several aspects of her character and worldview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Her social ambitions and desire to marry into the highest aristocracy</li>
<li>Her strategic thinking about how to attract his attention</li>
<li>Her class consciousness and valuation of titles and wealth</li>
<li>Her tendency toward romantic idealization</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie never actually meets or speaks with the Duke, observing him only from a distance. When she learns of his departure from Nice in early March 1873, she is devastated but quickly formulates a new plan to attract his attention through becoming a celebrated singer.</p>
<h2 id="continuing-obsession-1874">Continuing Obsession (1874)</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s obsession with the Duke of Hamilton continues throughout 1874, even after learning of his marriage. Notable developments include:</p>
<h3 id="august-1874-ostende">August 1874 - Ostende</h3>
<p>During her stay in Ostende, Marie&rsquo;s fixation intensifies:
- She questions a Scottish girl (Miss Foster&rsquo;s companion) about the Duke on August 25, 1874
- Learns his wife is &ldquo;not at all pretty, but she is very wild&rdquo;
- Hears accounts of the Duke racing with peasants on the Isle of Arran, which belongs to him
- The Scottish girl confirms &ldquo;his wife is as mad as he is&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="emotional-impact">Emotional Impact</h3>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diary reveals the depth of her continued obsession:
- August 17: Her aunt mentions rumors that &ldquo;Hamilton&rsquo;s wife is dead,&rdquo; causing Marie to smile and think despite knowing it&rsquo;s nonsense
- August 25: She experiences what she questions might be &ldquo;true love&rdquo; - feeling it only when she has &ldquo;seen, or spoken of, or thought of the Duke&rdquo;
- Unable to sleep, she writes &ldquo;His Grace the Duke of Hamilton&rdquo; on paper to place under her pillow (following Lise&rsquo;s advice for dreaming of someone)
- Falls asleep &ldquo;smiling, crying and raging&rdquo; over her feelings</p>
<h3 id="references-and-associations">References and Associations</h3>
<ul>
<li>August 11: In Brussels, anticipates seeing &ldquo;something that reminds me of Hamilton&rdquo;</li>
<li>August 17: During Wheelwright&rsquo;s racing accident, notes it occurred on a descent &ldquo;like where Carlo Hamilton fell&rdquo; (possibly a relative or the Duke himself using a racing name)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="later-life">Later Life</h2>
<p>While not mentioned in Marie&rsquo;s diary entries from this period, the Duke of Hamilton married Lady Mary Montagu in 1873, the same year as these diary entries. He later developed serious health problems related to alcoholism and died in 1895 at age 50.</p>
<p>Hamilton Palace, which so impressed Marie in her reading, was demolished in the 1920s due to structural problems caused by nearby mining.</p>

<p>Miss Elder was Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s English governess or teacher in Nice during 1873. As was common among aristocratic Russian families, English governesses were employed to teach language, deportment, and provide cultural education to young ladies.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_1">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Elder served several roles in Marie&rsquo;s education and daily life:
- <strong>Language Instructor</strong>: Taught Marie English, which she already spoke well
- <strong>Literary Advisor</strong>: Was &ldquo;astonished&rdquo; when Marie announced her intention to publish an article critiquing &ldquo;A Journey across the central plains of Europe&rdquo;
- <strong>Cultural Mediator</strong>: Provided Marie with information about social admirers, such as the American boy who &ldquo;admired&rdquo; her</p>
<p>Her reaction to Marie&rsquo;s literary ambitions reveals the unconventional nature of Marie&rsquo;s intellectual pursuits for a 13-year-old girl in 1873.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_23">Historical Context</h2>
<p>English governesses were highly sought after by Continental aristocratic families in the 19th century. They were expected to provide not just language instruction but also to impart British manners and cultural knowledge, which were considered essential for young ladies entering international society.

<h2 id="emile_zola"><a href="../Emile_Zola.md">Emile_Zola</a></h2>
<h1 id="emile-zola">Émile Zola</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_4">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (1840-1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, and a major figure in the literary school of naturalism. He was also an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_2">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff explicitly connected her diary to Zola&rsquo;s concept of the &ldquo;document humain&rdquo; (human document). In her diary&rsquo;s preface, she described it as &ldquo;très intéressant comme document humain&rdquo; and directly referenced Zola, telling readers to &ldquo;Demandez à M. Zola et même à M. de Goncourt, et même à Maupassant!&rdquo; (Ask Mr. Zola and even Mr. de Goncourt, and even Maupassant!).</p>
<p>Her fascination with Zola&rsquo;s ideas and the naturalist movement began after she started her artistic career at the Académie Julian in 1877. The connection was reinforced through her acquaintance with Jules Bastien-Lepage (1848-1884), which led her to actively participate in the naturalist movement. The aesthetics of naturalism aligned perfectly with her humanist and social views.</p>
<p>When Bashkirtseff was dying in 1884, she deliberately wrote the names of Zola, Goncourt, and Maupassant into her preface, asserting that her diary&rsquo;s value as reading matter lay in its status as a &ldquo;document humain&rdquo; - these literary giants would understand and validate its importance as an authentic record of human experience.</p>
<p>Zola&rsquo;s emphasis on detailed documentation of everyday life and his belief in literature as a scientific study of human behavior resonated deeply with Marie&rsquo;s own approach to her diary writing. Though they never met personally, Marie was part of the artistic and literary circles in Paris where Zola&rsquo;s influence was paramount, particularly in the late 1870s and early 1880s when naturalism was at its height.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_24">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Zola was born in Paris in 1840 and became one of the most influential writers of the late 19th century. He is known for his 20-novel series <em>Les Rougon-Macquart</em>, which follows two branches of a family during the Second French Empire.</p>
<p>As a prominent figure in the naturalist movement, Zola believed in the objective study of human behavior through literature. His works often depicted the harsh realities of working-class life and tackled controversial social issues.</p>
<p>Zola was also known for his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, publishing the famous open letter &ldquo;J&rsquo;Accuse…!&rdquo; in 1898, which accused the French government of antisemitism in the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus.</p>
<h2 id="literary-influence">Literary Influence</h2>
<p>Zola&rsquo;s naturalist approach emphasized:
- Detailed observation and documentation of reality
- Scientific objectivity in portraying human behavior
- Focus on the influence of heredity and environment on character
- Unflinching portrayal of all aspects of life, including the sordid and unpleasant</p>
<p>His essay &ldquo;The Experimental Novel&rdquo; (1880) became the seminal manifesto of naturalism, drawing inspiration from Claude Bernard&rsquo;s essay on experimental medicine. Zola viewed literature as a form of scientific documentation of human behavior and social conditions.</p>
<p>The naturalist movement appeared at the end of the 19th century in a favorable context, with the development of capitalism, the proletariat and large cities, and scientific progress. This offered naturalist writers new investigation methods and content. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;Plein Air movement&rdquo; in painting was parallel to what Zola inaugurated in literature - it was nature taking the citadel of art by storm. Marie Bashkirtseff participated in both movements, applying naturalist principles to her painting and her diary writing.</p>
<p>These principles influenced many writers of Marie&rsquo;s era, and extended the concept of &ldquo;document humain&rdquo; beyond fiction into personal writing. Marie&rsquo;s diary, written during the height of naturalism in 1870s-1880s Paris, represents an important example of how personal accounts were valued as authentic scientific records of human experience.</p>
<h2 id="notable-works">Notable Works</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Thérèse Raquin</em> (1867)</li>
<li><em>L&rsquo;Assommoir</em> (1877) - about alcoholism and poverty in working-class Paris</li>
<li><em>Nana</em> (1880) - about a prostitute</li>
<li><em>Germinal</em> (1885) - about a coal miners&rsquo; strike</li>
<li><em>J&rsquo;Accuse…!</em> (1898) - open letter on the Dreyfus Affair</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_3">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>While direct mentions of Zola in Marie&rsquo;s diary are limited, his influence on the literary and artistic culture of her time was significant. Marie&rsquo;s own artistic aspirations and her desire to document her life in detail show parallels with the naturalist movement that Zola championed.</p>

<h2 id="ferry"><a href="../Ferry.md">Ferry</a></h2>
<h1 id="ferry_1">Ferry</h1>
<h2 id="overview_17">Overview</h2>
<p>Ferry appears to be a bootmaker or shoe merchant in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned briefly in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s September 18, 1873 diary entry when she comments on the quality of boots she is wearing.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_4">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Ferry in her September 18, 1873 diary entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Avant <em>tout</em> ils chantent une messe funèbre et me rendent méchante (robe écrue de Dina, bien), bottines de Ferry, charmantes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Before <em>everything</em> they sing a funeral mass and make me angry (Dina&rsquo;s ecru dress, good), boots from Ferry, charming.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brief parenthetical comment suggests that Ferry was a source of footwear that Marie found particularly pleasing. The description of the boots as &ldquo;charmantes&rdquo; (charming) indicates her satisfaction with their quality or style.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_25">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the fashion-conscious society of 1870s Nice, quality footwear was an important element of a well-dressed appearance. For a young woman of Marie&rsquo;s social class, having well-made, fashionable boots would have been essential for social occasions, promenades, and everyday wear.</p>
<p>Bootmakers and shoemakers in fashionable resort towns like Nice would have catered to a wealthy clientele, including both local aristocracy and international visitors. They would have been expected to produce footwear that followed the latest Parisian fashions while providing comfort and durability.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s boots in the early 1870s typically featured:
- Button or lace closures
- Medium to high heels
- Pointed toes
- Fine leather construction
- Decorative elements such as contrasting stitching or materials</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s appreciation for her &ldquo;bottines de Ferry&rdquo; suggests that this particular bootmaker or merchant provided products that met her high standards for style and quality.</p>
<h2 id="business-and-location">Business and Location</h2>
<p>Without further mentions in the diary, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine whether Ferry was:</p>
<ol>
<li>A local bootmaker who custom-made footwear for clients</li>
<li>A merchant who sold ready-made boots, possibly imported from Paris or other fashion centers</li>
<li>A brand name of boots that Marie purchased from a local shop</li>
</ol>
<p>The possessive construction &ldquo;bottines de Ferry&rdquo; could indicate either that the boots were made by someone named Ferry or that they were purchased from a shop called Ferry.</p>
<p>In the context of Nice in the 1870s, it&rsquo;s most likely that Ferry was either a local artisan bootmaker or a shop specializing in quality footwear, catering to the wealthy international clientele that frequented the French Riviera during this period.</p>

<h1 id="french-theater-in-nice">French Theater in Nice</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_5">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The French Theater in Nice (Théâtre Français de Nice) was an important cultural venue in Nice during the 1870s. It hosted French-language theatrical productions, including both classical plays and contemporary comedies. The theater served as a social gathering place for the local elite and foreign visitors, particularly the Russian expatriate community that had established itself in Nice.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_3">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff attended the opening night of the 1873-1874 season at the French Theater on September 13, 1873. Her detailed description of this event provides valuable insights into both the theatrical culture of Nice and the social dynamics of the Russian community there.</p>
<p>For Marie, the theater represented an important social venue where she could display her fashion sense, observe others, and participate in the cultural life of Nice. Her diary entry about the theater visit reveals her concern with proper appearance (changing from her preferred gray dress to a white one at her mother&rsquo;s insistence) and her strong sense of social propriety (being scandalized by the presence of her father&rsquo;s mistress, Anna, in a nearby box).</p>
<p>The theater also served as a place of cultural education for Marie, as evidenced by her detailed summary of the play &ldquo;Le changement de mains&rdquo; about Empress Elisabeth of Russia, showing her interest in Russian history and theatrical narratives.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_26">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s, Nice had become a popular winter resort for wealthy Europeans, particularly Russians. The city had been part of the Kingdom of Sardinia until 1860, when it was annexed to France. This relatively recent change in national identity meant that Nice in the 1870s was a cosmopolitan city with Italian, French, and international influences.</p>
<p>The French Theater was part of Nice&rsquo;s cultural infrastructure that catered to this international elite. Theatrical performances were a central part of social life for the upper classes in the 19th century, providing entertainment, cultural enrichment, and opportunities for social display and interaction.</p>
<p>The 1873-1874 theater season opened with two productions: &ldquo;Le changement de mains&rdquo; (The Change of Hands), a historical drama set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of Empress Elisabeth, and &ldquo;Les jocrisses de l&rsquo;amour&rdquo; (The Fools of Love), a comedy that Marie found too risqué and left after the second act.</p>
<h2 id="social-significance">Social Significance</h2>
<p>The theater served multiple social functions beyond entertainment:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Display</strong>: The theater was a place to see and be seen, with attention paid to dress, appearance, and social connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Boundaries</strong>: The box system at the theater physically manifested social hierarchies, with better boxes indicating higher status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Boundaries</strong>: Marie&rsquo;s reaction to the &ldquo;crude&rdquo; comedy and her decision to leave shows how the theater could also be a site for negotiating moral propriety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Formation</strong>: For the Russian expatriate community in Nice, the theater provided a gathering place and cultural connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="georges_1">Georges</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_6">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Georges was a male family member of Marie Bashkirtseff, possibly a brother or cousin, who shared her refined sensibilities and disdain for their reduced circumstances at Villa Baquis. He appears to have been somewhat older than Marie and Paul.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_4">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Georges represented an important ally in Marie&rsquo;s social struggles:
- <strong>Sympathetic Confidant</strong>: Shared Marie&rsquo;s horror at their living situation at Villa Baquis
- <strong>Social Equal</strong>: Understood and validated Marie&rsquo;s concerns about their declining social position
- <strong>Drinking Companion</strong>: Attended social dinners and occasionally drank too much
- <strong>Voice of Agreement</strong>: Provided Marie with validation that her complaints were justified</p>
<p>His agreement with Marie&rsquo;s assessment of their situation (&ldquo;Il est parfaitement d&rsquo;accord&rdquo;) gave her ammunition in family discussions about their living arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_28">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In large aristocratic families, alliances often formed between family members who shared similar temperaments or views. Georges appears to have shared Marie&rsquo;s sensitivity to social status and her distress at their reduced circumstances, making him a natural ally in family disputes.</p>

<h2 id="gioia"><a href="../Gioia.md">Gioia</a></h2>
<h1 id="gioia_1">Gioia</h1>
<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Comprehensive
<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 2025-06-28
<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to 1873-02-18 (being updated)</p>
<h2 id="identity-and-background_2">Identity and Background</h2>
<p>Gioia is a woman frequently mentioned in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as the romantic interest or companion of the Duke of Hamilton. Her full identity is not clearly established in the diary entries, but based on Marie&rsquo;s descriptions, she appears to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful and fashionable woman in Nice society</li>
<li>Someone with enough social standing to associate with the Duke of Hamilton</li>
<li>Possibly Italian, based on her name</li>
<li>A rival who inspires intense jealousy in Marie</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maries-descriptions-and-observations">Marie&rsquo;s Descriptions and Observations</h2>
<p>Marie provides limited but telling details about Gioia throughout her diary:</p>
<ul>
<li>On February 18, 1873, Marie notes that &ldquo;Gioia had a magnificent dark red velvet dress&rdquo;</li>
<li>Marie believes the Duke visits Gioia&rsquo;s residence (February 27, 1873)</li>
<li>Marie assumes Gioia has left Nice with the Duke when his yacht departs (March 4, 1873)</li>
<li>Marie refers to Gioia as &ldquo;she&rdquo; with ellipses (&ldquo;he is in Paris with......her&rdquo;) suggesting her reluctance to even name her rival (March 10, 1873)</li>
<li>Marie fantasizes about the Duke leaving Gioia for her once she becomes famous: &ldquo;He will leave Gioia for me, I am sure&rdquo; (March 9, 1873)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="role-in-maries-narrative">Role in Marie&rsquo;s Narrative</h2>
<p>Gioia functions primarily as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Romantic Rival</strong>: She represents the obstacle between Marie and her idealized romance with the Duke</li>
<li><strong>Object of Envy</strong>: Marie envies her beauty, her fine clothing, and most importantly, her relationship with the Duke</li>
<li><strong>Standard for Comparison</strong>: Marie asserts &ldquo;I will be better than Gioia! Yes! with God&rsquo;s help!&rdquo; (March 9, 1873)</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie never describes any direct interaction with Gioia. Her knowledge of the woman appears to come entirely from observation at a distance and possibly social gossip.</p>
<h2 id="maries-perceptions-of-the-relationship">Marie&rsquo;s Perceptions of the Relationship</h2>
<p>Marie has complex theories about the relationship between Gioia and the Duke:</p>
<ul>
<li>She believes the Duke is &ldquo;too attached to Gioia&rdquo; (February 20, 1873)</li>
<li>She suggests Gioia retains the Duke &ldquo;not so much with her beauty as with habit, words, a thousand artifices!&rdquo; (February 20, 1873)</li>
<li>Later, Marie claims the Duke doesn&rsquo;t truly love Gioia but keeps her as a necessary accessory: &ldquo;I believe he doesn&rsquo;t love her, but he prefers to be free, to have a wife since it&rsquo;s necessary for chic, horses, a wife, pigeon shooting&rdquo; (March 4, 1873)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="historical-context_29">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The presence of women like Gioia in the social scene of Nice during the 1870s reflects several historical realities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The International Elite</strong>: Nice attracted wealthy and aristocratic visitors from across Europe during the winter season</li>
<li><strong>Social Arrangements</strong>: Aristocratic men often had companions who might be mistresses, courtesans, or women from slightly lower social ranks</li>
<li><strong>Social Observation</strong>: The public nature of society life in resort towns meant that relationships were visible and subject to gossip and speculation</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="possible-historical-identity">Possible Historical Identity</h2>
<p>While Marie provides insufficient information to identify Gioia with certainty, there are several possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>She could have been a high-society courtesan or mistress</li>
<li>She might have been a woman from the Italian aristocracy (the name Gioia is Italian)</li>
<li>She could potentially have been Lady Mary Montagu, whom the Duke of Hamilton married in 1873 (though this seems less likely given how Marie describes the relationship)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="significance-in-maries-development">Significance in Marie&rsquo;s Development</h2>
<p>Gioia represents Marie&rsquo;s first significant experience with romantic jealousy and rivalry. Her presence in the diary reveals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marie&rsquo;s competitive nature</li>
<li>Her tendency to idealize and romanticize relationships she observes from a distance</li>
<li>Her strategic thinking about how to surpass a rival (through becoming a famous singer)</li>
<li>Her class consciousness and social ambitions</li>
</ol>
<p>When Marie develops her plan to become a celebrated singer, surpassing Gioia becomes part of her motivation: &ldquo;I will be better than Gioia! Yes! with God&rsquo;s help!&rdquo; This transformation of jealousy into ambition marks an important development in Marie&rsquo;s thinking.</p>

<h2 id="hitchcock"><a href="../Hitchcock.md">Hitchcock</a></h2>
<h1 id="hitchcock_1">Hitchcock</h1>
<h2 id="overview_21">Overview</h2>
<p>Hitchcock (first name unknown) was Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s English conversation teacher in Nice during 1873. She is mentioned in Marie&rsquo;s September 15, 1873 diary entry as providing conversation lessons that Marie considered &ldquo;more useful than all other things.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_7">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Hitchcock in her September 15, 1873 diary entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mais j&rsquo;eus une leçon de conver­sation avec la Hitchcock, c&rsquo;est plus utile que toutes [les] autres choses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(But I had a conversation lesson with Hitchcock, it&rsquo;s more useful than all other things.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of the feminine article &ldquo;la&rdquo; before Hitchcock indicates that the teacher was a woman. Marie&rsquo;s comment about the usefulness of these conversation lessons suggests she valued practical language skills over more formal or theoretical language instruction.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_33">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s, English was becoming increasingly important as an international language, particularly in diplomatic and aristocratic circles. For a young woman of Marie&rsquo;s social class and ambitions, fluency in English would have been a valuable skill.</p>
<p>Language instruction in this period often emphasized grammar, translation, and reading comprehension over conversational ability. Marie&rsquo;s appreciation for conversation lessons with Hitchcock suggests she recognized the practical importance of being able to speak English fluently, not just read or write it.</p>
<p>Foreign language teachers for wealthy families in Nice during this period often came from the community of English and American expatriates who had settled in the French Riviera for health or leisure reasons. Hitchcock may have been a native English speaker who had settled in Nice and supplemented her income by teaching English to wealthy young women like Marie.</p>
<h2 id="educational-approach">Educational Approach</h2>
<p>The fact that Marie specifically mentions &ldquo;conversation lessons&rdquo; suggests that Hitchcock&rsquo;s teaching approach was focused on practical speaking skills rather than formal grammar instruction. This would have involved dialogue practice, pronunciation correction, and possibly discussion of current events or literature to build vocabulary and fluency.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s educational program was unusually comprehensive for a young woman of her time, including multiple languages (Russian, French, English, Italian, German, and Latin), as well as music, art, and sciences. Her English lessons with Hitchcock were part of this ambitious educational agenda.</p>

<h1 id="house-of-worth">House of Worth</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_7">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The House of Worth was a French haute couture fashion house founded by English designer Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895) in Paris in 1858. Located at 7 Rue de la Paix, it was the premier fashion house in Paris during the Second Empire and Belle Époque periods, essentially creating the concept of haute couture as we understand it today.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_5">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary entries from August 1873 reveal her fascination with the House of Worth and her desire to own garments from this prestigious establishment. During her visit to Paris, she mentions visiting Worth multiple times, including a morning visit on August 27 to order a dress before her departure.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s detailed descriptions of Worth dresses and their prices (700-1900 francs) demonstrate both the substantial cost of haute couture and her own social aspirations. Her preference for her Worth dress over creations from other fashion houses like Laferrière reflects Worth&rsquo;s superior status in the fashion hierarchy of the time.</p>
<p>For Marie, wearing Worth creations was not merely about fashion but about establishing her position in high society. Her willingness to spend significant sums on Worth garments, despite financial constraints, reveals the importance she placed on appearance and material display in the social world she inhabited and aspired to conquer.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_37">Historical Context</h2>
<p>By 1873, when Marie visited the establishment, the House of Worth was at the height of its influence and prestige. Charles Frederick Worth had revolutionized the fashion industry by transforming the traditional dressmaker into a fashion designer in the modern sense.</p>
<p>Worth pioneered many practices that became standard in the fashion industry:
- Using live models to present seasonal collections to clients
- Creating a brand identity and attaching his label to garments
- Presenting clients with designs to choose from rather than following their specifications
- Creating seasonal collections with new designs</p>
<p>The House of Worth dressed European royalty, including Empress Eugénie of France, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and Queen Victoria, as well as wealthy Americans and prominent figures from around the world. Worth&rsquo;s designs were characterized by rich fabrics such as silk, velvet, and satin, often incorporating multiple fabrics in a single garment with elaborate trimmings including lace, beading, and embroidery.</p>
<p>In 1873, Worth&rsquo;s designs featured elaborate bustle silhouettes that had replaced the earlier crinoline styles of the 1860s. The silhouette was characterized by a tight-fitting bodice and a skirt that projected at the back, supported by a bustle.</p>
<h2 id="later-history">Later History</h2>
<p>After Charles Frederick Worth&rsquo;s death in 1895, his sons Gaston-Lucien (1853-1924) and Jean-Philippe (1856-1926) continued the business. The House of Worth remained influential into the early 20th century but gradually declined in prominence with changing fashion trends after World War I. The house finally closed in 1952, though the Worth name was revived in 1999 for a perfume line.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>The Kursaal (from German: Kur = cure/treatment + Saal = hall) was the central social and entertainment venue at European spa resorts and seaside towns during the 19th century. In Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary, the Kursaal appears primarily in her accounts of Ostende (August 1874).</p>
<h2 id="the-ostende-kursaal">The Ostende Kursaal</h2>
<h3 id="architecture-and-location">Architecture and Location</h3>
<p>The Ostende Kursaal, built in 1851-1852, was positioned strategically between the beach and the town. Marie notes that her apartment at rue Longue 104 was &ldquo;in the middle of the path between the Kursaal and the casino,&rdquo; indicating its central location in the resort&rsquo;s geography.</p>
<h3 id="functions-and-facilities">Functions and Facilities</h3>
<p>The Kursaal served multiple social functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Concert Hall</strong>: Regular musical performances</li>
<li>Marie attended a concert on August 15 where Wieniawski&rsquo;s violin solo &ldquo;Je selle un cheval&rdquo; was performed</li>
<li>
<p>Professional musicians like Koutski performed there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading Salon</strong>: A refined space for socializing</p>
</li>
<li>Marie took refuge here during bad weather</li>
<li>Location for introductions and conversations</li>
<li>
<p>Where the Comte de Mulinare would pose and &ldquo;turn his gracious back&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dining Facilities</strong>: </p>
</li>
<li>Marie took breakfast subscriptions in &ldquo;cette espèce de serre&rdquo; (this kind of greenhouse)</li>
<li>
<p>The dining area on the digue (boardwalk) had views of the ocean</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Hub</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Meeting place for aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie</li>
<li>Venue for making social connections</li>
<li>Center for observing and being observed</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="social-significance_1">Social Significance</h2>
<p>The Kursaal represented:
- <strong>Cosmopolitan Culture</strong>: International elite gathered here
- <strong>Structured Leisure</strong>: Organized entertainment for the upper classes
- <strong>Social Theater</strong>: A stage for display and observation
- <strong>Cultural Refinement</strong>: Classical music and educated conversation</p>
<h2 id="maries-experiences">Marie&rsquo;s Experiences</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s relationship with the Kursaal was complex:
- She appreciated the musical performances
- Used it as a base for social operations
- Found refuge there during storms
- Conducted her &ldquo;Plobster&rdquo; observations from its salons
- Site of her introduction to various aristocrats</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_39">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Kursaals were essential features of 19th-century resort architecture, representing the commercialization and democratization of leisure. They provided structured entertainment for the growing numbers of wealthy tourists seeking health cures and social diversion at seaside and spa resorts.</p>
<p>The Ostende Kursaal, in particular, was known for attracting an international clientele and maintaining high cultural standards, making it a perfect venue for Marie&rsquo;s social ambitions and observations.</p>

<h1 id="le-bon-marche">Le Bon Marché</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_8">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Le Bon Marché was the first modern department store in Paris and a pioneering institution in retail history. Founded in 1838 as a small haberdashery by Aristide Boucicaut and his wife Marguerite, it underwent significant expansion in the early 1870s to become a revolutionary shopping destination. By 1873, when Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris, Le Bon Marché had recently been expanded with the help of Gustave Eiffel&rsquo;s engineering firm and featured 22 departments across multiple floors with wide, open interiors.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_6">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Le Bon Marché in her diary during her Paris visit in August 1873. Her cousin Dina suggested visiting the store, but Marie dismissed the idea, considering it beneath her social standing. Marie&rsquo;s diary entry notes that she considered shopping at Le Bon Marché as reflecting &ldquo;vulgaire&rdquo; tastes, which reveals her aristocratic aspirations and social snobbery.</p>
<p>This attitude toward department stores versus exclusive boutiques and fashion houses like Worth and Laferrière demonstrates Marie&rsquo;s preoccupation with social status and her desire to associate herself with the highest echelons of society. Despite the store&rsquo;s growing popularity and innovative retail concepts, Marie preferred the exclusive experience of haute couture establishments and specialized boutiques.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_40">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Le Bon Marché revolutionized retail in the 19th century by introducing several innovations that define modern department stores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed pricing (replacing the traditional haggling system)</li>
<li>The ability to browse freely without obligation to buy</li>
<li>A wide variety of goods under one roof</li>
<li>Seasonal sales and special promotions</li>
<li>Money-back guarantees</li>
<li>Home delivery services</li>
</ul>
<p>The store catered particularly to women of the growing middle class, offering them a respectable public space to shop independently. By the 1870s, Le Bon Marché had become not just a shopping destination but a social institution and tourist attraction.</p>
<p>The 1870s expansion, completed in 1872, transformed the store into an architectural marvel with iron and glass construction, grand staircases, and a light-filled central hall. The Boucicauts also introduced innovative employee benefits including profit-sharing, pension plans, free medical care, and educational opportunities for staff.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s dismissal of Le Bon Marché reflects a common attitude among the aristocracy and those with aristocratic aspirations, who often viewed department stores as catering to the bourgeoisie despite the fact that these establishments were transforming consumer culture across all social classes.</p>
<h2 id="later-history_1">Later History</h2>
<p>Le Bon Marché continued to thrive and expand in the decades following Marie&rsquo;s visit. In 1887, it moved to its current location on the Left Bank of Paris, in a building designed by Louis-Charles Boileau and Gustave Eiffel. The store survived both World Wars and remains in operation today as an upscale department store owned by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.</p>

<h1 id="le-ravin-the-precipice">Le ravin (The Precipice)</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_9">Basic Information</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Le ravin&rdquo; (The Precipice) is a Russian novel that Marie Bashkirtseff mentions reading in her September 1873 diary entries. Based on her descriptions of the characters and plot elements, this appears to be &ldquo;Обрыв&rdquo; (The Precipice) by Ivan Goncharov, published in 1869. In her diary, Marie refers to it by its French translation title &ldquo;Le ravin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-novel-and-its-author">The Novel and Its Author</h2>
<p>Ivan Goncharov (1812-1891) was a major Russian novelist of the 19th century, best known for his novel &ldquo;Oblomov&rdquo; (1859). &ldquo;The Precipice,&rdquo; his third and final novel, was published in 1869 after being serialized in the journal &ldquo;Vestnik Evropy&rdquo; (The European Herald). The novel explores themes of generational conflict, the changing social landscape of Russia, and the clash between traditional values and new, radical ideas.</p>
<p>The novel centers around a love triangle involving the young, idealistic artist Raisky, his cousin Vera, and the nihilist Mark Volokhov. Set in a provincial Russian town on the Volga River, the story unfolds against the backdrop of a literal precipice that becomes a metaphor for the moral and social dangers facing Russian society.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_7">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s engagement with &ldquo;Le ravin&rdquo; reveals several aspects of her intellectual and cultural life:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Literary Interests</strong>: Despite claiming to have &ldquo;mépris pour les romans&rdquo; (contempt for novels), Marie shows genuine enthusiasm for this Russian novel, particularly enjoying its humor and character development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russian Cultural Identity</strong>: Her reading of contemporary Russian literature in French translation demonstrates her connection to Russian culture despite living abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intellectual Capacity</strong>: Her detailed analysis of the characters and plot shows her sophisticated literary understanding at the young age of 14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading Habits</strong>: Marie mentions that she &ldquo;n&rsquo;ai jamais la patience de finir un roman&rdquo; (never has the patience to finish a novel), yet she continues reading this one in installments, suggesting that it particularly captured her interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="maries-commentary-on-the-novel">Marie&rsquo;s Commentary on the Novel</h2>
<p>In her September 6, 1873 entry, Marie provides a detailed and enthusiastic assessment of the novel and its characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>She finds the dream sequence of the character Vikentieff &ldquo;extrarisible&rdquo; (extremely funny)</li>
<li>She describes the grandmother character as &ldquo;sublime&rdquo;</li>
<li>She characterizes Marfinka as &ldquo;charmante&rdquo; (charming)</li>
<li>She calls Vera &ldquo;folle&rdquo; (crazy/wild)</li>
<li>She describes Mark as &ldquo;original insolent&rdquo; (originally insolent)</li>
<li>She particularly enjoys Vikentieff, finding him &ldquo;plein d&rsquo;humour et de verve&rdquo; (full of humor and verve)</li>
</ul>
<p>Her cousin Dina was so taken with Vikentieff&rsquo;s dream sequence that she wanted to retell it as her own, changing the character names to those of people they knew.</p>
<h2 id="historical-and-cultural-context">Historical and Cultural Context</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s reading of &ldquo;The Precipice&rdquo; in 1873, just four years after its publication, shows that she kept up with contemporary Russian literature despite living in France. The novel would have been particularly relevant to Russians living abroad, as it deals with questions of Russian identity and the tension between traditional Russian values and Western European influences.</p>
<p>The fact that Marie was reading the novel in French translation (&ldquo;Le ravin&rdquo;) rather than in the original Russian may reflect her educational background. While she was fluent in multiple languages, her formal education had been primarily in French, which may have made reading complex literary works easier in that language.</p>

<p>The title &ldquo;Les diables roses&rdquo; (The Pink Devils) suggests a light comedy or vaudeville piece, which were popular entertainment in French theaters of the 1870s.

<h2 id="london_house"><a href="../London_House.md">London_House</a></h2>
<h1 id="london-house">London House</h1>
<p>London House was a popular upscale confectionery and café in Nice frequently mentioned in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary. It served as both a refreshment spot and a social hub for the aristocracy and wealthy visitors to the French Riviera in the 1870s.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Based on Marie&rsquo;s diary entries, London House appears to have been an elegant establishment with multiple rooms or sections. It featured a counter staffed by women who, according to Marie, understood English conversations. The café was spacious enough to accommodate multiple small tables and served as a meeting place where patrons might encounter acquaintances.</p>
<h2 id="location_2">Location</h2>
<p>While the exact address is not specified in Marie&rsquo;s diary, London House was located in central Nice, apparently near the Promenade des Anglais. Marie mentions walking from the promenade to London House on multiple occasions, suggesting it was conveniently situated for the city&rsquo;s fashionable visitors.</p>
<h2 id="menu-and-offerings">Menu and Offerings</h2>
<p>London House offered an extensive menu of refreshments and delicacies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot chocolate (Marie&rsquo;s frequent order)</li>
<li>Ice cream (&ldquo;des glaces magnifiques&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Pastries and cakes</li>
<li>Fruits (oranges, grapes, strawberries, peaches)</li>
<li>Smoked salmon</li>
<li>Foie gras</li>
<li>Sandwiches</li>
<li>Preserved meats (&ldquo;cochon de lait en conserve&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Champagne</li>
</ul>
<p>Marie describes one particularly eclectic meal at London House: &ldquo;trois petites tables rondes de différentes hauteurs réunies, sur lesquelles on voit à la fois servis du chocolat, du saumon fumé, des glaces, des gâteaux, des sandwichs, des fraises, du foie gras et du raisin, sans couverts&rdquo; (three small round tables of different heights joined together, on which were served all at once chocolate, smoked salmon, ice cream, cakes, sandwiches, strawberries, foie gras and grapes, without cutlery).</p>
<h2 id="social-significance_2">Social Significance</h2>
<p>London House played an important role in Marie&rsquo;s social life in Nice. It was a place where she would:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Socialize with friends</strong>: Marie frequently visited with &ldquo;Bête&rdquo; (Miss Howard), her father, or other companions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Observe society</strong>: The café provided opportunities to see and be seen by Nice&rsquo;s high society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage in conversation</strong>: Many of Marie&rsquo;s significant conversations about the Duke of Hamilton and other matters took place at London House.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find comfort</strong>: Marie notes, &ldquo;Toutes les fois que je suis au London House je suis gaie&rdquo; (Every time I am at London House I am cheerful).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish routine</strong>: Marie mentions being &ldquo;si habituée à aller avant dîner au London House&rdquo; (so accustomed to going to London House before dinner).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="historical-context_42">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Establishments like London House catered to the international aristocracy and wealthy tourists who flocked to Nice during the winter season. The name &ldquo;London House&rdquo; itself reflects the strong British presence in Nice during this period. The French Riviera had become a fashionable winter resort for the British aristocracy since the late 18th century, and by the 1870s, Nice had a substantial English-speaking community.</p>
<p>Such cafés and confectioneries served as important social spaces where the elite could display their wealth and status while enjoying luxuries imported from across Europe. The presence of English-speaking staff and English food items (like smoked salmon) indicates how these establishments catered specifically to the international clientele of Nice.</p>

<p>This reference triggers Marie&rsquo;s imagination - she writes about how she would be &ldquo;inflamed&rdquo; at the sight of such luxury items, wanting to buy everything, to be known there, and to order custom items.</p>
<p>Lyon was an important commercial and industrial center in France, regularly hosting trade exhibitions showcasing luxury goods, textiles (for which Lyon was famous), and carriages.</p>

<h2 id="overview_28">Overview</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ma tante&rdquo; (my aunt) is one of the most important figures in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s early diary entries. Her name is Sophie, as revealed in the December 1873 entries. She served as Marie&rsquo;s primary guardian during the family&rsquo;s travels through Europe in 1873-1874, particularly during their stays in Vienna, Baden-Baden, Paris, and Nice.</p>
<h2 id="role-in-maries-life">Role in Marie&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s aunt acted as:
- <strong>Primary Guardian</strong>: Responsible for Marie&rsquo;s day-to-day care and decisions during their European travels
- <strong>Financial Manager</strong>: Controlled the family purse strings and made decisions about purchases and travel
- <strong>Chaperone</strong>: Accompanied Marie to social events, shops, and cultural activities
- <strong>Indulgent Caretaker</strong>: Despite occasional conflicts, she was notably devoted to Marie</p>
<h2 id="character-traits">Character Traits</h2>
<p>Based on Marie&rsquo;s descriptions:
- <strong>Devoted</strong>: &ldquo;Comme ma tante m&rsquo;adore!&rdquo; (How my aunt adores me!) - August 11, 1873
- <strong>Protective</strong>: Quick to defend Marie against Paul&rsquo;s teasing
- <strong>Cautious with Money</strong>: Often cited financial concerns when resisting Marie&rsquo;s wishes
- <strong>Ultimately Yielding</strong>: Despite initial resistance, usually gave in to Marie&rsquo;s persistent requests</p>
<h2 id="notable-interactions">Notable Interactions</h2>
<h3 id="the-paris-campaign-august-1873">The Paris Campaign (August 1873)</h3>
<p>One of the most revealing episodes occurs on August 12, 1873, when Marie desperately wants to go to Paris for shopping. Her aunt initially refuses firmly, citing lack of funds. Marie describes an extended negotiation:
- Initial firm refusal
- Marie&rsquo;s persistent but gentle pleading
- Calculations about costs
- Eventual capitulation with &ldquo;oui&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pattern - initial resistance followed by surrender to Marie&rsquo;s wishes - characterizes their relationship throughout the diary.</p>
<h3 id="daily-devotion">Daily Devotion</h3>
<p>Marie frequently notes her aunt&rsquo;s devoted attention:
- Waiting for Marie to go to bed before retiring
- Never making decisions without considering Marie
- Immediately coming to Marie&rsquo;s defense when Paul teases her</p>
<h2 id="relationship-dynamics">Relationship Dynamics</h2>
<p>The relationship reveals:
- Marie&rsquo;s awareness of her power over her aunt
- Her aunt&rsquo;s genuine affection despite Marie&rsquo;s manipulation
- The complex dynamics of a guardian trying to be both authority figure and loving relative
- Marie&rsquo;s mixed feelings of gratitude and occasional frustration</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_45">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In 19th century European aristocratic families, unmarried or widowed female relatives often served as guardians and chaperones for young women. This aunt fulfilled the crucial role of maintaining propriety while allowing Marie considerable freedom for her age and era.</p>

<p>On April 10, 1875, Marie arrives in Cannes at 7 PM and instead of talking, she sings &ldquo;l&rsquo;Archiduc&rdquo; and &ldquo;acts like a madwoman.&rdquo; This shows her exuberant, performative nature.</p>
<h2 id="musical-context">Musical Context</h2>

<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Basic

<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to 1874-01-01</p>
<h2 id="overview_30">Overview</h2>
<p>Makaroff (sometimes spelled Makarof in different sources) was one of Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s teachers during her stay in Nice in 1873. He appears to have been a Russian expatriate who provided private lessons to children of Russian noble families.</p>
<h2 id="role-as-teacher">Role as Teacher</h2>
<p>From Marie&rsquo;s diary entries:
- <strong>Subject</strong>: The specific subject he taught is not clearly stated in the early entries
- <strong>Teaching Quality</strong>: Marie describes him as &ldquo;excellent professeur&rdquo; despite finding him personally ridiculous
- <strong>Schedule</strong>: Regular lessons were part of Marie&rsquo;s educational routine</p>
<h2 id="personality-and-character">Personality and Character</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s assessments of Makaroff are notably contradictory:
- <strong>As a Teacher</strong>: &ldquo;excellent professeur&rdquo; (excellent teacher)
- <strong>As a Person</strong>: &ldquo;Il est si bête et drôle&rdquo; (He is so stupid and funny)
- <strong>Social Behavior</strong>: &ldquo;Il est vraiment maniéré&rdquo; (He is really affected/mannered)</p>
<h2 id="notable-incidents">Notable Incidents</h2>
<h3 id="the-apology-incident-september-1-1873">The Apology Incident (September 1, 1873)</h3>
<p>One of the most detailed accounts involves a social conflict:
- Makaroff spoke too loudly and assertively (&ldquo;d&rsquo;une manière tranchante&rdquo;) regarding his brother
- The &ldquo;princess&rdquo; and others teased him about it
- Makaroff apologized to Marie&rsquo;s father (Papa) but was rebuffed
- He became very embarrassed and confused by the situation
- This incident reveals the delicate social dynamics among the Russian expatriate community</p>
<h3 id="his-brother">His Brother</h3>
<p>References to Makaroff&rsquo;s brother suggest:
- Described as &ldquo;cet espèce de fou&rdquo; (that kind of madman)
- Source of embarrassment or concern for Makaroff
- The brother said &ldquo;impertinences&rdquo; during social gatherings</p>
<h2 id="social-position_4">Social Position</h2>
<p>Makaroff&rsquo;s position appears complex:
- <strong>Professional Respect</strong>: Valued as an educator
- <strong>Social Awkwardness</strong>: Often the subject of mockery in social situations
- <strong>Russian Expatriate Community</strong>: Part of the Russian circle in Nice but not fully accepted socially</p>
<h2 id="teaching-style">Teaching Style</h2>
<p>While Marie doesn&rsquo;t detail his teaching methods, her comment about him being an &ldquo;excellent professor&rdquo; despite his personal quirks suggests he was:
- Knowledgeable in his subject
- Effective in his instruction
- Professional in his teaching role</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-the-bashkirtseff-family">Relationship with the Bashkirtseff Family</h2>
<p>The relationship appears professionally cordial but socially strained:
- Regular presence for lessons
- Involved in family social situations
- Subject to Marie&rsquo;s sharp observations and judgments
- Some tension with Marie&rsquo;s father</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_46">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Private tutors and teachers were essential for the education of aristocratic children in the 19th century, especially for Russian families living abroad. These teachers often occupied an awkward social position - necessary for the family but not quite equals.</p>
<h2 id="maman"><a href="../Maman.md">Maman</a></h2>
<h1 id="maman-maria-stepanovna-babanina">Maman (Maria Stepanovna Babanina)</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_10">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Maria Stepanovna Babanina (1833-1920) was Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s mother and a significant influence in her life. She came from the Russian <em>petite noblesse</em> (lesser nobility) and was proud of her Tatar ancestry.</p>
<h2 id="family-background_1">Family Background</h2>
<p>Maria Stepanovna married Konstantin Bashkirtseff, but the couple separated in 1862 when Marie was still a young child. Following the separation, Maria took primary responsibility for raising Marie and managing the family affairs.</p>
<h2 id="role-in-maries-life_1">Role in Marie&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>In 1870, Maria Stepanovna left Russia with young Marie and traveled extensively across Europe before eventually settling in Nice, France, and later Paris. She was deeply involved in managing the family&rsquo;s affairs and was instrumental in supporting Marie&rsquo;s artistic ambitions.</p>
<p>Maria tailored the family&rsquo;s lifestyle and relocations to accommodate Marie&rsquo;s fragile health and career aspirations. Her decisions about where the family would live and how they would participate in society significantly shaped Marie&rsquo;s experiences and opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="appearances-in-the-diary">Appearances in the Diary</h2>
<p>In Marie&rsquo;s diary, &ldquo;Maman&rdquo; (the French word for mother) appears frequently. Marie often mentions her mother&rsquo;s activities, such as attending social events, musical performances, and making social calls. The January 18, 1873 entry notes that &ldquo;Maman a dansé&rdquo; (Mother danced) at the Cercle Masséna, indicating her active participation in Nice&rsquo;s social scene.</p>
<p>The January 30, 1873 entry mentions &ldquo;Maman et Dina sont à une matinée musicale à l&rsquo;hôtel Chauvain, au profit d&rsquo;un pauvre Russe&rdquo; (Mother and Dina are at a musical matinee at the Chauvain hotel, for the benefit of a poor Russian), showing Maria&rsquo;s continued connection to Russian cultural events even while living abroad.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_47">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Maria Stepanovna&rsquo;s decision to leave Russia and settle in Western Europe was part of a broader pattern among the Russian aristocracy in the late 19th century. Many noble Russian families spent significant time in resort cities like Nice, creating expatriate communities that maintained Russian customs while adopting aspects of Western European lifestyles.</p>
<p>As a separated woman managing her family&rsquo;s affairs independently, Maria Stepanovna navigated the complex social expectations of her time. Her ability to establish her family in the competitive social circles of Nice and Paris demonstrated both her social skills and determination.</p>
<h2 id="later-life_1">Later Life</h2>
<p>Maria Stepanovna outlived her daughter, who died of tuberculosis in 1884 at the age of 25. After Marie&rsquo;s death, Maria continued to support the preservation of her daughter&rsquo;s legacy, helping to ensure that Marie&rsquo;s artwork and diary were recognized for their artistic and historical significance.</p>

<h2 id="overview_31">Overview</h2>
<p>Marie Ivanovna Perlik appears in a crucial anecdote in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary entry of September 1, 1873. She is presented as a woman who tried to warn Marie&rsquo;s mother against marrying Constantin Bashkirtseff (Marie&rsquo;s father).</p>
<h2 id="the-warning-story">The Warning Story</h2>
<p>As recounted in the diary:
- Marie Ivanovna Perlik warned Marie&rsquo;s mother not to marry Bashkirtseff
- The warning was not heeded
- The story is told in a context suggesting the marriage was indeed unfortunate
- This anecdote helps explain the family&rsquo;s separated state in 1873</p>
<h2 id="significance_4">Significance</h2>

- <strong>Explains Current Situation</strong>: Helps contextualize why Marie&rsquo;s parents live separately

- <strong>Suggests Regret</strong>: Implies Marie&rsquo;s mother may have regretted ignoring the warning</p>

<h2 id="michelezzi"><a href="../Michelezzi.md">Michelezzi</a></h2>
<h1 id="michelezzi_1">Michelezzi</h1>
<h2 id="overview_32">Overview</h2>
<p>Michelezzi (first name unknown) was Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Italian teacher in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned in Marie&rsquo;s September 15, 1873 diary entry when she proudly describes speaking Italian for the first time, causing her teacher to nearly &ldquo;faint or throw himself out the window&rdquo; with surprise or delight.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_11">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Michelezzi in her September 15, 1873 diary entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;J&rsquo;ai pour la première fois parlé l&rsquo;italien aujourd&rsquo;hui. Le pauvre Michelezzi faillit tomber évanoui ou se jeter par la fenêtre. Je suis contente moi-même, je puis dire que je <em>parle</em> le russe, le français, l&rsquo;anglais et l&rsquo;italien. J&rsquo;apprends l&rsquo;alle­mand et le latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I spoke Italian for the first time today. Poor Michelezzi nearly fainted or threw himself out the window. I am pleased with myself, I can say that I <em>speak</em> Russian, French, English, and Italian. I am learning German and Latin.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s description of Michelezzi&rsquo;s dramatic reaction suggests either that her progress was unexpectedly good or that he was an expressive, emotional teacher. The fact that she emphasizes this as the &ldquo;first time&rdquo; she spoke Italian indicates that previous lessons may have focused on reading, writing, or grammar rather than conversation.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_50">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Italian was an important language for educated Europeans in the 19th century, particularly for those interested in art, music, and culture. Nice&rsquo;s proximity to Italy (having only been annexed by France from the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860) meant that Italian culture and language remained influential in the region.</p>
<p>For a young woman of Marie&rsquo;s social class and artistic aspirations, knowledge of Italian would have been valuable for appreciating opera, reading classical literature, and participating in cosmopolitan society. The Italian language was also practical for travel in Italy, which was a common destination for wealthy Europeans.</p>
<h2 id="educational-approach_1">Educational Approach</h2>
<p>Based on Marie&rsquo;s description of suddenly speaking Italian for the first time, it appears that Michelezzi&rsquo;s teaching approach may have initially emphasized passive knowledge (reading, grammar) before active production (speaking). This was a common language teaching methodology in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s pride in her linguistic accomplishments is evident in this entry, as she lists the four languages she can now speak (Russian, French, English, and Italian) and mentions two more she is studying (German and Latin). This ambitious language program reflects both her intellectual capabilities and the expectations for educated young women in aristocratic European society.</p>

<h2 id="miloradovitch"><a href="../Miloradovitch.md">Miloradovitch</a></h2>
<h1 id="miloradovitch_1">Miloradovitch</h1>
<p>Gritsia Miloradovitch was a young Russian nobleman who appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as a potential suitor strongly favored by her mother. </p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Miloradovitch came from a wealthy Russian family, with Marie mentioning he had an annual income of 75,000 rubles, which she considered insufficient despite her mother&rsquo;s insistence that it was &ldquo;énorme&rdquo; (enormous). He was described as young, handsome, and importantly &ldquo;seul&rdquo; (alone) - without siblings, which Marie noted was &ldquo;un grand bonheur&rdquo; (a great happiness) in terms of inheritance.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-marie_3">Relationship with Marie</h2>
<p>Marie knew Miloradovitch from childhood in Russia. She mentions that when she left Russia at age eleven, &ldquo;ce Miloradovitch m&rsquo;a fait la cour, mais nous étions enfants&rdquo; (this Miloradovitch courted me, but we were children). Her mother and aunt cherished the romantic notion of a childhood love blossoming into marriage, with Marie noting they spoke of it as &ldquo;si poétique, depuis l&rsquo;enfance, un amour éternel&rdquo; (so poetic, since childhood, an eternal love).</p>
<h2 id="maries-attitude">Marie&rsquo;s Attitude</h2>
<p>Marie consistently rejected the idea of marrying Miloradovitch, despite her mother&rsquo;s persistent efforts to arrange a match. She described him dismissively as &ldquo;un enfant gâté&rdquo; (a spoiled child) and &ldquo;un petit rien-du-tout&rdquo; (a little nothing-at-all). Her objection stemmed partly from his lack of experience - she noted he &ldquo;n&rsquo;a pas fait de bêtises&rdquo; (hasn&rsquo;t made mistakes/had experiences), which she considered a negative trait in a potential husband.</p>
<p>When comparing him to the Duke of Hamilton, Marie wrote: &ldquo;Miloradovitch est riche, jeune, noble et seul, mais je ne l&rsquo;aime pas. Hamilton a tout.&rdquo; (Miloradovitch is rich, young, noble and alone, but I don&rsquo;t love him. Hamilton has everything.)</p>
<h2 id="mothers-matchmaking">Mother&rsquo;s Matchmaking</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s mother was determined to arrange a marriage between Marie and Miloradovitch. In her diary, Marie notes that her mother wanted her to travel to Vienna partly because &ldquo;à Vienne sont Mme Miloradovitch et son fils&rdquo; (in Vienna are Madame Miloradovitch and her son). Her mother hoped to arrange &ldquo;une espèce d&rsquo;entrevue comme le duc d&rsquo;Edimbourg et la duchesse Marie; par hasard nous voir à Vienne&rdquo; (a kind of meeting like the Duke of Edinburgh and Duchess Marie; by chance to see each other in Vienna).</p>
<p>Marie frequently complained about her mother&rsquo;s persistence on this matter, writing &ldquo;Maman ne pense qu&rsquo;à Miloradovitch&rdquo; (Mama thinks only of Miloradovitch) and &ldquo;C&rsquo;est le rêve le plus cher de maman que j&rsquo;épouse Miloradovitch, elle ne pense qu&rsquo;à cela&rdquo; (It is mama&rsquo;s dearest dream that I marry Miloradovitch, she thinks only of that).</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_51">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The Miloradovitch family was a prominent noble family in the Russian Empire. While we don&rsquo;t have specific biographical details about Gritsia Miloradovitch from external sources, the family name was well-known. The most famous bearer of the name was Count Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich (1771-1825), a Russian general who fought in the Napoleonic Wars and was killed during the Decembrist uprising.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s rejection of Miloradovitch in favor of her infatuation with the Duke of Hamilton reflects the social aspirations of the Russian nobility in the late 19th century, many of whom looked to Western European aristocracy as socially superior.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Collignon is Marie&rsquo;s French governess during the Nice period (1873). She appears frequently in the diary entries, accompanying Marie on walks, visits, and various outings. Her role seems to be a combination of chaperone, companion, and educator.</p>

<p>The brevity of Marie&rsquo;s mention and the formal title &ldquo;Mme&rdquo; indicate this was likely a social acquaintance rather than an intimate friend. Evening visits were a common social practice among the expatriate community in Nice during this period.</p>

<h1 id="monte-carlo">Monte-Carlo</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_11">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Monte-Carlo is a district of the Principality of Monaco, a small sovereign state on the French Riviera. It became internationally famous in the late 19th century for its casino and gambling facilities. The Monte-Carlo Casino, officially opened in 1863, was developed by the Société des Bains de Mer (SBM), founded by François Blanc, with the support of Prince Charles III of Monaco as a way to save the House of Grimaldi from bankruptcy.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_8">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Monte-Carlo appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as a leisure destination for her family and the Russian expatriate community in Nice. Located just a short distance from Nice, it was easily accessible by train or carriage, making it a popular day-trip destination.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diary entries reveal that visits to Monte-Carlo were a regular part of her social life. She mentions gambling at the casino, dining at the restaurants, and encountering acquaintances there. These visits provided entertainment and social opportunities for Marie and her family, who were part of the wealthy international community that frequented the French Riviera.</p>
<p>Her September 7, 1873 entry provides a particularly detailed account of a visit to Monte-Carlo, including her participation in gambling (unusual for a 14-year-old girl), her frustration at missing the train back to Nice, and her chance sighting of Gioia (the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s mistress) at the casino.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_54">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s, Monte-Carlo was establishing itself as one of Europe&rsquo;s premier gambling and leisure destinations. The success of the casino had transformed Monaco from a poor principality into a wealthy playground for the aristocracy and the nouveau riche. The Belle Époque architecture, luxurious facilities, and the mild Mediterranean climate made it particularly attractive to wealthy Russians, who had begun to establish a significant presence on the French Riviera.</p>
<p>The Monte-Carlo Casino was not just a gambling establishment but a complex that included a theater (the Salle Garnier, opened in 1879), restaurants, and other entertainment facilities. It attracted visitors from across Europe, particularly during the winter season when the wealthy fled the cold northern climates for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Monaco did not charge income tax to its residents, making it an attractive place for the wealthy. This tax advantage, combined with the gambling facilities and luxurious amenities, helped establish Monte-Carlo&rsquo;s reputation as a playground for the rich.</p>
<h2 id="social-significance_3">Social Significance</h2>
<p>Monte-Carlo served several important social functions for the expatriate community on the French Riviera:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Networking</strong>: The casino and its surrounding facilities provided a venue for the international elite to see and be seen, make connections, and display their wealth and status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong>: Beyond gambling, Monte-Carlo offered concerts, theatrical performances, and fine dining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gambling Culture</strong>: The casino represented a particular form of aristocratic leisure that combined risk-taking, wealth display, and social interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gender Dynamics</strong>: Marie&rsquo;s participation in gambling, despite her young age, reflects the somewhat more permissive attitudes toward women&rsquo;s behavior in these international resort settings compared to more traditional environments.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="mouton"><a href="../Mouton.md">Mouton</a></h2>
<h1 id="mouton_1">Mouton</h1>
<h2 id="overview_38">Overview</h2>
<p>Mouton appears in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as someone associated with horses in Nice during 1873. Based on the context of Marie&rsquo;s mentions, he was likely a stable owner, horse dealer, or riding instructor from whom Marie rented or borrowed horses for her rides.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_13">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie first mentions Mouton in her January 11, 1873 diary entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Les Howard étaient venus me chercher, mais la canaille Mouton ne m&rsquo;a pas envoyé le cheval.. J&rsquo;ai fait plusieurs fois le tour en voiture en suivant les chevaux; j&rsquo;étais en amazone, puis j&rsquo;ai changé de toilette à la promenade; une délicieuse robe bleue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The Howards had come to get me, but the scoundrel Mouton did not send me the horse.. I went around several times in a carriage following the horses; I was in a riding habit, then I changed clothes at the promenade; a delightful blue dress.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her reference to Mouton as &ldquo;la canaille&rdquo; (the scoundrel/rascal) and her frustration at not receiving the expected horse indicates their business relationship was sometimes contentious.</p>
<p>Marie mentions Mouton again in her September 15, 1873 diary entry when describing problems with her horse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Il faut que je me trouve bien mal pour descendre du cheval, car je pouvais à peine arriver chez Mouton, je lui rendis le cheval avec un scolding et je remontais en voiture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I must have been feeling quite unwell to get off the horse, because I could barely reach Mouton&rsquo;s place, I returned the horse to him with a scolding and got back into the carriage.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that Mouton was someone to whom Marie would return a horse after riding, indicating he owned or managed horses that Marie used.</p>
<p>In her September 19, 1873 entry, Marie again mentions Mouton when having trouble with her saddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mais la selle devient inquiétante et je vais chez Mouton qui l&rsquo;arrange encore une fois, et encore une fois elle recule. Enfin, aux Ponchettes, je me vois définitivement contrainte de quitter mon Pégase, je monte en landau et Paul furieux prend les rênes du cheval. Tout le temps jusqu&rsquo;à Mouton il rageait et je riais de sa rage&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(But the saddle becomes worrying and I go to Mouton&rsquo;s who arranges it once more, and once more it slips back. Finally, at the Ponchettes, I find myself definitively forced to leave my Pegasus, I get into the landau and Paul, furious, takes the reins of the horse. The whole time until [we reached] Mouton&rsquo;s he was raging and I was laughing at his rage&hellip;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage confirms that Mouton had a physical location (&ldquo;chez Mouton&rdquo;) where horses could be taken, and that he provided services such as adjusting saddles. The fact that Paul took the horse &ldquo;jusqu&rsquo;à Mouton&rdquo; (until [we reached] Mouton&rsquo;s) after Marie had to abandon her ride further suggests that Mouton was the person from whom the horse was obtained and to whom it would be returned.</p>
<h2 id="role-and-business">Role and Business</h2>
<p>Based on these mentions, Mouton appears to have been:</p>
<ol>
<li>A stable owner, horse dealer, or riding master in Nice</li>
<li>Someone who provided horses for Marie&rsquo;s rides</li>
<li>Someone who could adjust or repair riding equipment like saddles</li>
<li>Someone with a physical establishment (&ldquo;chez Mouton&rdquo;) where horses could be taken</li>
</ol>
<p>In 19th century Nice, horseback riding was an important social activity for the aristocracy and wealthy visitors. Establishments that provided horses for hire, riding lessons, and related services were essential to support this activity. Mouton&rsquo;s business would have catered to this wealthy clientele, including visitors like Marie and her family.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_55">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s, before the widespread adoption of automobiles, horses were the primary means of transportation and recreation for the upper classes. In resort towns like Nice, which attracted wealthy visitors from across Europe, businesses that provided horses and related services were important parts of the local economy.</p>
<p>For a young woman of Marie&rsquo;s social class, horseback riding was both a leisure activity and a social accomplishment. The ability to ride well was considered an important skill for young women of the aristocracy, and riding on the promenade was a way to see and be seen in society.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s frustration with the poorly fitting saddle that &ldquo;recule&rdquo; (slips back) during her rides suggests that the equipment provided by Mouton may not have been of the highest quality, or perhaps was not properly adjusted for a female rider.</p>

<h2 id="overview_40">Overview</h2>
<p>Ostende (French spelling of Ostend), a fashionable Belgian seaside resort on the North Sea coast where Marie Bashkirtseff spent August 1874 with her family. The city was a major summer destination for European aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie during the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id="maries-stay-in-ostende">Marie&rsquo;s Stay in Ostende</h2>
<p>Marie arrived in Ostende on August 12, 1874, after leaving Spa. She stayed with her mother, aunt, and entourage initially at various hotels before settling in an apartment at rue Longue, n° 104, which she described as a &ldquo;doll&rsquo;s apartment&rdquo; with an ocean view balcony between the Kursaal and the Casino.</p>
<h2 id="social-life-and-venues">Social Life and Venues</h2>
<h3 id="key-locations">Key Locations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Kursaal</strong>: The main social venue where concerts were held and society gathered. Marie attended concerts here and socialized in the reading salon.</li>
<li><strong>The Casino</strong>: Scene of elegant balls, including the grand races ball where Marie caused a sensation with her pink outfit and remarkable shoes.</li>
<li><strong>Cercle des Bains</strong>: Another social venue that alternated dancing nights with the Casino.</li>
<li><strong>The Estacade (Pier)</strong>: Where Marie would walk and contemplate, becoming melancholy as she thought about the Duke of Hamilton.</li>
<li><strong>The Digue (Boardwalk)</strong>: Where society promenaded and took subscriptions for dining in the greenhouse-like structures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="society-and-encounters">Society and Encounters</h2>
<p>During her stay, Marie encountered various members of European aristocracy:
- Count Doenhoff (Prussian court official)
- Count Noël de Leiser (Polish nobleman naturalized English)
- Count Dounine-Barkovsky
- The young princes Kara-Georgevitch
- Various &ldquo;Plobsters&rdquo; (Marie&rsquo;s code word for attractive men)</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_58">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the 1870s, Ostende was known as the &ldquo;Queen of Belgian Beach Resorts.&rdquo; The city attracted an international clientele, particularly during the summer racing season. The presence of royalty and aristocracy from across Europe made it a crucial stop on the social circuit.</p>
<p>The Kursaal, built in 1851-1852, was the center of cultural life, hosting concerts, balls, and other entertainments. The races were major social events that drew crowds from across Europe.</p>
<h2 id="transportation_1">Transportation</h2>
<p>Ostende was well-connected by railway to Brussels and other major European cities. Marie&rsquo;s journey from Spa to Ostende took her through Brussels, where she stayed briefly at the Grand Hôtel Gernay.</p>
<h2 id="maries-impressions">Marie&rsquo;s Impressions</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s feelings about Ostende were mixed. While she enjoyed the social opportunities and the attention she received (particularly at the races ball), she also experienced melancholy and continued to pine for the Duke of Hamilton. She noted the &ldquo;dirty world but quantity of it&rdquo; - appreciating the crowds while maintaining her aristocratic disdain.</p>
<p>Her most memorable moment was the sensation caused by her pink outfit with Chinese-pointed shoes at the ball on August 25, where she reported that people &ldquo;almost cried out&rdquo; upon seeing her feet.</p>

<h2 id="overview_41">Overview</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s father, Constantin Bashkirtseff (sometimes written as Bashkirtseff), appears in her diary as &ldquo;papa.&rdquo; He was a Russian nobleman and landowner from the Poltava region of Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire).</p>
<h2 id="background_1">Background</h2>
<p>From Marie&rsquo;s diary entries and historical context:
- <strong>Russian Nobleman</strong>: Part of the landed gentry class
- <strong>Landowner</strong>: Owned estates in the Poltava region
- <strong>Separated from Family</strong>: By 1873, he was living separately from Marie and her mother</p>
<h2 id="business-interests">Business Interests</h2>
<p>The diary reveals several of his business activities:
- <strong>Tobacco Production</strong>: At the 1873 Vienna World Exhibition, his tobacco was displayed (secretly arranged by someone named Sacha as a surprise). Marie writes on August 13, 1873: &ldquo;En Russie nous trouvâmes le tabac de papa. <em>Sacha</em> lui a fait une surprise en exposant.&rdquo;
- <strong>Wine Interests</strong>: Associated with Lefèvre wines, also displayed at the Vienna Exhibition</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-marie_4">Relationship with Marie</h2>
<p>The diary entries from 1873-1874 suggest:
- <strong>Limited Contact</strong>: Marie rarely sees her father during this period
- <strong>Complex Family Dynamics</strong>: References to &ldquo;amour-propre&rdquo; (pride/self-respect) and various conflicts
- <strong>Emotional Distance</strong>: Marie&rsquo;s mentions of him are often matter-of-fact rather than affectionate</p>
<h2 id="marriage-history">Marriage History</h2>
<p>A revealing entry from September 1, 1873, recounts a story about his marriage:
- Marie Ivanovna Perlik warned Marie&rsquo;s mother against marrying Bashkirtseff
- The warning went unheeded, suggesting later regrets
- This story implies a troubled marriage that may explain the family&rsquo;s separation</p>
<h2 id="character-traits_2">Character Traits</h2>
<p>Based on diary references:
- <strong>Pride</strong>: Described as having significant &ldquo;amour-propre&rdquo;

<h1 id="paris-in-the-1870s">Paris in the 1870s</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_12">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Paris in the 1870s was a city in transition, recovering from the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune uprising (1871) while reestablishing itself as the cultural and fashion capital of Europe. The early 1870s marked the beginning of the Third Republic in France, a period of political reorganization following the fall of Napoleon III&rsquo;s Second Empire.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_9">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris in August 1873 and developed a deep admiration for the city. Her diary entries reveal her enthusiasm for Paris as the cultural and fashion capital of the world. She writes passionately about the city&rsquo;s atmosphere, the quality of the people she sees, and her desire to eventually move there from Nice.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;Tous les endroits sont égaux pour moi excepté Paris que j&rsquo;adore et Nice que j&rsquo;abhorre&rdquo; (All places are equal to me except Paris, which I adore, and Nice, which I abhor) reveals her strong preference for the cultural and social opportunities of Paris over the provincial atmosphere of Nice.</p>
<p>For Marie, Paris represented opportunity, sophistication, and the possibility of achieving her artistic and social ambitions. Her shopping experiences at prestigious establishments like the House of Worth, her visits to cultural venues, and her observations of Parisian society all reinforced her desire to establish herself in this cosmopolitan environment.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_60">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Paris in 1873 was in a period of recovery and transformation. The city had suffered significant damage during the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent Paris Commune uprising. The siege of Paris (September 1870 to January 1871) had caused severe hardship, and the violent suppression of the Commune in May 1871 had resulted in thousands of deaths and the destruction of numerous buildings.</p>
<p>By 1873, reconstruction efforts were underway, guided by urban planner Baron Haussmann&rsquo;s earlier vision of a modern city with wide boulevards, grand public spaces, and improved infrastructure. The Third Republic, established in 1870, was still consolidating its political structures, with monarchist factions maintaining significant influence in the early 1870s.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Paris was regaining its position as a center of culture, fashion, and society. The city&rsquo;s theaters, opera houses, and other cultural venues were active, and its fashion houses, including the House of Worth, continued to set international trends. The Parisian elite maintained their social rituals, including promenades in the Bois de Boulogne and attendance at the opera and theater.</p>

<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 2025-07-04
<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to 1874-08-31</p>
<h2 id="definition-and-origin">Definition and Origin</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Plobster&rdquo; is Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s invented code word for men who attract her attention, either through genuine appeal or ridiculous behavior. The term appears to be her creation, possibly a playful combination of words or a private joke within her circle.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-usage">Evolution of Usage</h2>
<h3 id="initial-usage-1874">Initial Usage (1874)</h3>
<p>The term first appears in Marie&rsquo;s diary during her time in Spa and Ostende in summer 1874. Initially, it seems to refer to attractive, aristocratic men whom Marie admires:
- &ldquo;Ce que je regrette le plus ce sont les Plobsters d&rsquo;ici qui sont admirables&rdquo; (What I regret most are the Plobsters here who are admirable) - August 11, 1874, leaving Spa
- She speaks of the quality and quantity of Plobsters at Spa</p>
<h3 id="expanded-meaning">Expanded Meaning</h3>
<p>By late August 1874, the term evolves to include men who are objects of mockery:
- The Comte de Mulinare/Moelenar becomes &ldquo;Plobster&rdquo; due to his excessive posing and ridiculous behavior
- Marie notes he&rsquo;s &ldquo;not a real Plobster&rdquo; when his conversation reveals lack of polish
- She refers to &ldquo;le vrai et le premier de la dynastie des Plobster&rdquo; (the true and first of the Plobster dynasty)</p>
<h2 id="social-function_1">Social Function</h2>
<p>The term serves multiple purposes in Marie&rsquo;s social world:
1. <strong>Private Language</strong>: Creates insider communication within her circle
2. <strong>Social Commentary</strong>: Allows her to categorize and judge men
3. <strong>Entertainment</strong>: Provides amusement through observation and mockery
4. <strong>Protection</strong>: Offers emotional distance through humor</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-plobsters">Examples of Plobsters</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admired Plobsters</strong>: The high-quality aristocrats at Spa</li>
<li><strong>Ridiculous Plobsters</strong>: Comte de Mulinare with his lobster-like appearance and excessive posing</li>
<li><strong>Potential Plobsters</strong>: Men seeking introduction who don&rsquo;t meet standards</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cultural-context_4">Cultural Context</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s invention of this term reflects:
- The leisure culture of 19th-century European spas and resorts
- Young women&rsquo;s need for coded language to discuss men
- The sport of people-watching as entertainment
- Her sharp wit and tendency toward social satire</p>
<h2 id="linguistic-note">Linguistic Note</h2>
<p>The word may derive from:
- A corruption or play on &ldquo;lobster&rdquo; (homard in French), especially given her comparison of Moelenar to a lobster
- A private joke or nonsense word
- A combination of other terms known only to Marie&rsquo;s circle</p>
<p>The term demonstrates Marie&rsquo;s linguistic creativity and her delight in creating private vocabularies for her observations of society.</p>

<h2 id="russia"><a href="../Russia.md">Russia</a></h2>
<h1 id="russia_1">Russia</h1>
<h2 id="overview_44">Overview</h2>
<p>Russia plays a significant role in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s identity and background. Though she spent much of her life in Western Europe, Marie was born in Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) and maintained strong cultural and familial ties to Russia throughout her life.</p>
<h2 id="maries-russian-background">Marie&rsquo;s Russian Background</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff (Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva) was born on November 24, 1858, in Gavrontsi near Poltava in what is now Ukraine but was then part of the Russian Empire. She came from a wealthy noble family with estates in Ukraine. Her father, Konstantin Bashkirtseff, was a marshal of nobility in the Poltava region.</p>
<p>When Marie was about 12 years old, her mother, Maria Stepanovna Bashkirtseva (née Babanina), separated from her father and took Marie and her brother to travel throughout Europe, eventually settling primarily in Nice, France. Despite living abroad, the family maintained their Russian customs, language, and connections.</p>
<h2 id="russian-cultural-elements-in-maries-diary">Russian Cultural Elements in Marie&rsquo;s Diary</h2>
<p>Throughout her diary, Marie makes numerous references to Russian customs, holidays, and cultural practices:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Russian New Year</strong>: In her January 13, 1873 entry, Marie mentions &ldquo;Notre nouvel an&rdquo; (Our New Year), referring to the Russian Orthodox New Year, which was celebrated according to the Julian calendar, 13 days after the Western (Gregorian calendar) New Year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russian Orthodox Church</strong>: Marie and her family attended Russian Orthodox services, maintaining their religious ties to their homeland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russian Language</strong>: Though Marie wrote her diary primarily in French, she was fluent in Russian and occasionally used Russian expressions or referenced conversations in Russian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russian Social Circle</strong>: In Nice and Paris, Marie&rsquo;s family maintained connections with other Russian expatriates and aristocrats, forming a social circle that preserved Russian cultural practices and social norms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="russia-in-the-1870s">Russia in the 1870s</h2>
<p>During the period covered in Marie&rsquo;s diary, Russia was undergoing significant changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Political Context</strong>: Tsar Alexander II (reigned 1855-1881) had implemented major reforms, including the emancipation of serfs in 1861, but Russia remained an autocratic empire with significant social stratification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International Relations</strong>: Russia&rsquo;s relations with Western Europe were complex during this period. The Crimean War (1853-1856) had ended in Russia&rsquo;s defeat, but by the 1870s, Russia was rebuilding its international position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russian Aristocracy Abroad</strong>: Many wealthy Russian nobles, like the Bashkirtseff family, spent significant time in Western Europe, particularly in resort cities like Nice, creating expatriate communities that blended Russian traditions with Western European lifestyles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural Developments</strong>: This was a period of significant cultural development in Russia, with writers like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky producing major works, and Russian music and art gaining international recognition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="maries-relationship-with-russia">Marie&rsquo;s Relationship with Russia</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s relationship with her Russian heritage was complex:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural Identity</strong>: While Marie embraced French culture and artistic traditions, she maintained aspects of her Russian identity throughout her life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Status</strong>: Her status as a Russian noblewoman was an important part of her social identity in Western European society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Family Connections</strong>: Despite living abroad, Marie maintained connections with relatives in Russia and Ukraine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artistic Recognition</strong>: Later in her life, as Marie developed her artistic career, her Russian background became part of her artistic identity in the Parisian art world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="historical-significance_4">Historical Significance</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diary provides valuable insights into the lives of Russian expatriate nobility in Western Europe during the late 19th century. Her documentation of Russian customs practiced abroad, her family&rsquo;s social connections, and her own complex cultural identity offers a window into the transnational nature of European aristocratic society during this period.</p>
<p>The Russian elements in Marie&rsquo;s diary also highlight the significant Russian cultural presence in places like Nice during the late 19th century, when Russian aristocrats formed an important part of the international social scene in European resort cities.</p>

<h2 id="said"><a href="../Said.md">Said</a></h2>
<h1 id="said_1">Saïd</h1>
<h2 id="overview_47">Overview</h2>
<p>Saïd appears to be a servant or staff member in the Bashkirtseff household in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned briefly in Marie&rsquo;s September 17, 1873 diary entry when she discusses ordering a livery (uniform) for him.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_16">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Saïd in her September 17, 1873 diary entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A quatre heures, je veux sor­tir pour commander une livrée à Saïd, des bottes pour moi et je ne me souviens plus quoi encore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(At four o&rsquo;clock, I want to go out to order a livery for Saïd, boots for myself, and I don&rsquo;t remember what else.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brief mention suggests that Saïd was a servant or staff member for whom Marie was ordering a uniform. The fact that Marie was responsible for ordering his livery indicates her role in managing certain household affairs, despite her young age.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_69">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The name &ldquo;Saïd&rdquo; is Arabic in origin, suggesting he may have been from North Africa, possibly Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco, which were French colonies or protectorates during this period. It was not uncommon for wealthy European families in the late 19th century to employ servants from the colonies.</p>
<p>Liveries were uniforms worn by household servants, particularly those who had public-facing roles such as footmen, coachmen, or valets. The fact that Marie was ordering a livery for Saïd suggests he may have had one of these roles, possibly as a footman or personal attendant who would accompany family members in public.</p>
<p>In the social hierarchy of a wealthy household in the 1870s, the appearance of servants was considered a reflection of the family&rsquo;s status. Well-dressed servants in proper liveries were a sign of wealth and social standing. Marie&rsquo;s attention to ordering a livery for Saïd reflects this concern with maintaining appropriate appearances.</p>
<h2 id="possible-roles">Possible Roles</h2>
<p>Based on the limited information available, Saïd might have been:</p>
<ol>
<li>A footman who would accompany family members on outings, open doors, carry packages, etc.</li>
<li>A personal attendant to Marie or another family member</li>
<li>A coachman or assistant to the coachman (though this seems less likely as Marie mentions other coachmen by name elsewhere)</li>
<li>A household servant with duties that required him to be seen by visitors, thus necessitating a livery</li>
</ol>
<p>Without further mentions in the diary, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine Saïd&rsquo;s exact role in the household. However, the fact that Marie was ordering a livery for him indicates he had some visibility or public-facing role that required formal attire.</p>

<p>Scotland is mentioned in the May 1, 1873 entry in a significant context. When discussing summer travel plans at lunch, Mlle Collignon suggests &ldquo;the mountains of Scotland&rdquo; while looking at Marie, causing her to blush intensely. </p>
<p>This appears to be a reference to the Duke of Hamilton, whom Marie loves, as the Dukes of Hamilton are one of Scotland&rsquo;s premier noble families with extensive estates in Scotland. The governess&rsquo;s pointed suggestion seems to be teasing Marie about her romantic interest.</p>

<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Comprehensive<br />

<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to April 8, 1875  </p>
<h2 id="identity_253">Identity</h2>
<p>Sir Frederic Johnstone (1841-1913) was a British baronet and racing enthusiast who became one of Marie&rsquo;s romantic obsessions during her time in Nice. He was known for his involvement in the racing world and his connections to the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s circle.</p>
<h2 id="maries-encounter">Marie&rsquo;s Encounter</h2>
<p>Marie first spotted Johnstone on January 10, 1875, while riding in a landau with Dina near the Jardin Public in Nice. She describes him as a &ldquo;galant comme Carlo&rdquo; - comparing him to her idealized romantic type. This brief encounter made a lasting impression on her.</p>
<h2 id="physical-description_2">Physical Description</h2>
<p>Marie observed him walking on the boulevard toward the Promenade des Anglais, hands in his pockets, yawning as their carriage passed. She was struck by his appearance and boldly leaned out of the carriage to get a better look.</p>
<h2 id="maries-obsession_3">Marie&rsquo;s Obsession</h2>
<p>By April 1875, Johnstone had become part of Marie&rsquo;s romantic fantasies alongside the Duke of Hamilton, Prince of Wales, and others. She writes passionate invocations to him: &ldquo;Johnstone beau, Johnstone noble, Johnstone fier, Johnstone charmant, Johnstone grand, viens me visiter en rêve, tu me plais, tu es beau!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_72">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Johnstone moved in the same social circles as the Prince of Wales and other British aristocrats who wintered in Nice. He represented the type of sophisticated, aristocratic gentleman that Marie idealized.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-maries-development_1">Significance in Marie&rsquo;s Development</h2>
<p>Johnstone becomes another figure in Marie&rsquo;s gallery of unattainable aristocratic men, reflecting her social aspirations and romantic imagination at age 16-17.</p>

<p>Solominka appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s 1873 diary as a regular companion and member of their social circle in Nice. The name suggests Russian or Eastern European origins, fitting with the expatriate community around the Bashkirtseffs.</p>

<p>Sophie is Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s aunt (&ldquo;ma tante&rdquo;), one of the most important figures in her early diary. Throughout 1873-1874, Sophie served as Marie&rsquo;s primary guardian during the family&rsquo;s European travels.</p>
<h2 id="confirmed-relationship">Confirmed Relationship</h2>
<p>The December 1873 entries clearly establish Sophie as &ldquo;ma tante&rdquo;:
- December 15, 1873: &ldquo;maman, ma tante, moi, Dina&rdquo; - Sophie is referenced as &ldquo;ma tante&rdquo; in family groupings
- December 25, 1873: Multiple references confirm Sophie is the aunt who:
  - Picks up Marie from social events
  - Participates in family discussions about society figures
  - Makes observations about other people like Gioia</p>
<h2 id="role-in-maries-life_5">Role in Marie&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Sophie is mentioned as:

<h2 id="historical-context_74">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In wealthy 19th century households, it was common to have:

<h2 id="soubise"><a href="../Soubise.md">Soubise</a></h2>
<h1 id="soubise_1">Soubise</h1>
<h2 id="overview_50">Overview</h2>
<p>Soubise was a woman in Nice who appears in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as a companion or friend of Gioia, the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s mistress. Marie mentions her in September 1873 entries, comparing her to someone named &ldquo;Pitou&rdquo; and noting her presence with Gioia during encounters in Nice.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_17">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Soubise in her September 15, 1873 diary entry when describing an encounter with Gioia while horseback riding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A la promenade je vois une femme jolie et gracieuse, c&rsquo;est Gioia, je l&rsquo;ai reconnue après l&rsquo;avoir passée. Je retourne of course, elle marche avec la Soubise, fi !&rdquo;</p>
<p>(At the promenade I see a pretty and graceful woman, it&rsquo;s Gioia, I recognized her after passing her. I turn around of course, she is walking with Soubise, fie!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression &ldquo;fi!&rdquo; suggests Marie&rsquo;s disdain for this association.</p>
<p>In her September 19, 1873 entry, Marie again mentions Soubise when describing another encounter with Gioia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tout à coup, je vois arriver Gioia avec Pitou (Soubise ressemble au feu Pitou comme une sœur).&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Suddenly, I see Gioia arriving with Pitou (Soubise resembles the late Pitou like a sister).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the same entry, Marie comments on Gioia and Soubise&rsquo;s mode of transportation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Et quelle misère avec La Soubise en fiacre. Est-ce pareil aux années d&rsquo;avant, non, non.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(And what misery with Soubise in a hired cab. Is it the same as in previous years, no, no.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This comment suggests that Marie sees their use of a hired cab (fiacre) as a sign of reduced circumstances compared to previous years.</p>
<h2 id="character-and-social-position">Character and Social Position</h2>
<p>Based on Marie&rsquo;s limited mentions, we can infer that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Soubise was a woman in Nice society who associated with Gioia, the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s mistress</li>
<li>She physically resembled someone known as &ldquo;Pitou&rdquo; (possibly deceased, given the phrase &ldquo;feu Pitou&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Marie seems to look down on her, as suggested by the dismissive &ldquo;fi!&rdquo; after mentioning her</li>
<li>Her traveling in a hired cab with Gioia is noted by Marie as a sign of reduced social status compared to previous years</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that Marie refers to her as &ldquo;la Soubise&rdquo; (with the definite article) might suggest she was known by a title or surname rather than a first name, which was common in referring to certain social classes in 19th century France.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_75">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In the social hierarchy of Nice in the 1870s, women associated with aristocratic men as mistresses or companions often formed their own social circles. Soubise may have been part of this demi-monde - women who were not accepted in respectable society but who moved in wealthy circles due to their relationships with aristocratic or wealthy men.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s comment about Soubise and Gioia using a hired cab suggesting reduced circumstances reflects the importance of maintaining appearances in this social milieu. The type of transportation one used was a significant marker of social status and financial means.</p>

<p>A young man who appears to be pursuing Marie and her companions in Nice. The name may be a pseudonym or nickname that Marie uses to refer to him.</p>
<h2 id="maries-observations_1">Marie&rsquo;s Observations</h2>
<p>On April 14, 1875, Marie and her companions (Dina, Marie, and Olga) agree not to look at Terffidua during a musical performance. He appears to be pursuing them, which delights her three companions and amuses Marie herself.</p>

<p><strong>Research Status</strong>: Basic
<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 2025-06-30
<strong>Diary Coverage</strong>: Up to 1874-01-01</p>
<h2 id="overview_56">Overview</h2>
<p>The Tolstoy family appears 19 times in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary during 1873-1874. While the name immediately brings to mind the famous writer Leo Tolstoy, the diary references appear to be to members of the broader Tolstoy family who were part of the Russian expatriate community in Nice.</p>
<h2 id="the-tolstoy-connection">The Tolstoy Connection</h2>
<p>The Tolstoys mentioned were likely:
- <strong>Extended Family Members</strong>: The Tolstoy family was large and prominent
- <strong>Not Leo Tolstoy</strong>: The writer was at Yasnaya Polyana during this period
- <strong>Social Peers</strong>: Part of the same aristocratic circles as the Bashkirtseffs
- <strong>Nice Residents</strong>: Either permanent or seasonal residents</p>
<h2 id="social-context_23">Social Context</h2>
<p>The Tolstoy family in Nice:
- Participated in the Russian expatriate social life
- Attended the same events as Marie&rsquo;s family
- Maintained aristocratic Russian customs abroad
- Part of the international winter colony</p>
<h2 id="historical-background_1">Historical Background</h2>
<p>The Tolstoy family was:
- <strong>Ancient Russian Nobility</strong>: Counts since Peter the Great&rsquo;s time
- <strong>Extensive Family</strong>: Many branches across Russia and Europe
- <strong>Culturally Prominent</strong>: Beyond Leo, many were involved in arts and letters
- <strong>Internationally Connected</strong>: Comfortable in European capitals</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-maries-circle">Relationship to Marie&rsquo;s Circle</h2>
<p>The Tolstoys appear as:
- <strong>Regular Acquaintances</strong>: Mentioned matter-of-factly
- <strong>Social Equals</strong>: Part of the same class and nationality
- <strong>Neither Intimate nor Distant</strong>: Professional social relationships
- <strong>Cultural Companions</strong>: Sharing language and customs</p>
<h2 id="the-writer-question">The Writer Question</h2>
<p>Why these are likely NOT references to Leo Tolstoy:
- Leo Tolstoy was at his estate during 1873-1874
- He rarely traveled to fashionable resorts
- His spiritual crisis period was beginning
- He disapproved of the lifestyle Marie&rsquo;s diary depicts</p>
<p>These Tolstoys were probably:
- Cousins or distant relatives of the writer
- Maintaining the traditional aristocratic lifestyle
- Part of the &ldquo;old&rdquo; Russia that Leo Tolstoy was rejecting</p>
<h2 id="cultural-significance_5">Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>The presence of Tolstoys in Nice represents:
- The breadth of Russian noble families abroad
- The irony of aristocratic life (given Leo&rsquo;s criticism of it)
- The international nature of 19th century nobility
- The preservation of Russian identity in exile</p>
<h2 id="questions-for-further-research_12">Questions for Further Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Which specific Tolstoy family members were in Nice?</li>
<li>What was their exact relationship to Leo Tolstoy?</li>
<li>Did Marie ever meet or mention the famous writer?</li>
<li>Were these Tolstoys permanent expatriates?</li>
<li>How did they view their famous relative&rsquo;s increasingly radical views?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="note-on-spelling">Note on Spelling</h2>
<p>Marie uses the French spelling &ldquo;Tolstoï&rdquo; which was common in French-speaking circles. This confirms she was writing for a French-reading audience and saw herself as part of international rather than purely Russian society.</p>

<h1 id="vienna-world-exhibition-of-1873">Vienna World Exhibition of 1873</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_14">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The Vienna World Exhibition (Weltausstellung 1873 Wien) was held from May 1 to November 2, 1873, in the Austro-Hungarian capital. It was the fifth world exposition and the first to be held in a German-speaking country. The exhibition was designed to showcase industrial, cultural, and scientific achievements from around the world and coincided with Emperor Franz Joseph I&rsquo;s 25th anniversary as ruler.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_11">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie visited the Vienna World Exhibition during her stay in Vienna in August 1873. In her diary entries from August 11-15, 1873, she mentions visiting the &ldquo;Exposition&rdquo; several times. On August 13, she specifically notes visiting the &ldquo;Agrikulturhalle&rdquo; (Agricultural Hall) where she found her father&rsquo;s tobacco on display. She also mentions seeing Lefèvre&rsquo;s wine.</p>
<p>Her visits to the exhibition represent her family&rsquo;s participation in elite cultural events and their connections to European high society. The fact that her father&rsquo;s tobacco was displayed at the exhibition also indicates the family&rsquo;s economic interests and status.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_80">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The Vienna World Exhibition faced significant challenges, including the stock market crash of May 1873 (part of the global &ldquo;Panic of 1873&rdquo;) and a concurrent cholera epidemic, which severely impacted attendance. This may explain Marie&rsquo;s mention of her aunt&rsquo;s fear of cholera when Marie became ill on August 14.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the fair was the Rotunda, the world&rsquo;s largest domed building at the time, surrounded by themed halls including the Palace of Industry and the Hall of Engines. National exhibits showcased both technological innovation and traditional arts, emphasizing cultural pride.</p>
<p>The exhibition aimed to elevate Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s status among major European powers like France and Britain. Despite financial difficulties and lower-than-expected attendance (about 7 million visitors compared to the projected 20 million), the exhibition succeeded in showcasing Vienna as a cultural and technological center.</p>

<h2 id="basic-information_15">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Villa Baquis, which Marie contemptuously calls &ldquo;Buffa,&rdquo; was the Bashkirtseff family&rsquo;s residence in Nice during 1873. Located in what Marie considered an inferior neighborhood, the villa represented a significant step down from their previous accommodations and became a symbol of the family&rsquo;s declining social position.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_12">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>The villa was a source of constant mortification for Marie:
- <strong>Social Embarrassment</strong>: Marie felt the residence was beneath their station, calling it &ldquo;une auberge&rdquo; (an inn) and &ldquo;un trou&rdquo; (a hole)
- <strong>Physical Inadequacy</strong>: She complained about the dark staircase, small miserable salon, poor entrance, and general shabbiness
- <strong>Symbol of Decline</strong>: Represented their fall from their beloved former residence, Acqua Viva
- <strong>Social Limitation</strong>: Marie believed the poor address affected their ability to maintain proper social connections</p>
<p>Her hatred of the villa reveals her acute sensitivity to social status and her understanding that address and appearances mattered enormously in 19th-century society.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_81">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In 19th-century Nice, as in most European resort towns, one&rsquo;s address was a crucial indicator of social standing. The international aristocracy who wintered on the Riviera were acutely aware of which neighborhoods and villas were fashionable. A family&rsquo;s choice of residence could determine their social opportunities and the caliber of guests they could receive.</p>
<p>Nice in the 1870s was divided into distinct quarters, with the most fashionable families residing in villas along the Promenade des Anglais or in the hills above the town.</p>

<p>A substantial property in Nice that the Bashkirtseff family purchased in February 1874 for 218,000 francs. Located on rue de la Préfecture, it became their new residence.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="context_271">Context</h2>
<p>Villa Carlone represents a significant real estate investment by the Bashkirtseff family in Nice. The purchase price of 218,000 francs was substantial for the era, indicating a luxurious property befitting the family&rsquo;s wealth and social status. The fact that construction or renovation work by Biasini was included in the price suggests the property may have required updates or customization to meet the family&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Located on rue de la Préfecture, the villa would have been in a prestigious area of Nice, suitable for wealthy Russian expatriates who formed a significant part of Nice&rsquo;s winter colony during this period.</p>

<h2 id="walery_studio"><a href="../Walery_Studio.md">Walery_Studio</a></h2>
<h1 id="walery-studio">Walery Studio</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_16">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The Walery photography studio was a prestigious portrait photography establishment in Paris during the late 19th century. It was founded by Count Stanisław Julian Ostroróg (1830-1890), a Polish nobleman who fled to France after participating in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He established the studio under the name &ldquo;Walery&rdquo; (derived from his wife&rsquo;s name, Waleria).</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_13">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff visited the Walery studio on August 26, 1873, during her stay in Paris. Her diary entry about this visit provides valuable insights into both the world of high-end portrait photography in 1870s Paris and Marie&rsquo;s own emotional state.</p>
<p>At the studio, Marie was particularly fixated on viewing portraits of Gioia, a beautiful woman connected to the Duke of Hamilton (the object of Marie&rsquo;s infatuation). Marie&rsquo;s repeated viewing of Gioia&rsquo;s photographs and comparison of herself to this beautiful woman reveals her insecurities about her own appearance and attractiveness.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s desire to have her portrait taken at Walery reflects both the studio&rsquo;s growing reputation as a fashionable establishment and her own social aspirations. Her visit to this prestigious studio aligns with her broader efforts to establish herself in Parisian high society through association with elite establishments.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_84">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The Walery studio at 9 Rue de Londres in Paris had been established around 1871-1872, making it relatively new but already fashionable when Marie visited in 1873. The studio quickly gained fame for its portraits of celebrities, aristocrats, and beautiful women of the era.</p>
<p>Walery specialized in theatrical photography and portraits of opera singers, actresses, and other performers, which explains why Marie saw portraits of Gioia there. By 1873, the studio was becoming one of the most fashionable photography establishments in Paris, attracting clients from high society.</p>
<p>Walery&rsquo;s portraits were characterized by their dramatic lighting, elegant poses, and attention to detail. The photographs were often distributed as cabinet cards and cartes de visite, which were popular collectibles among the upper classes.</p>
<h2 id="later-history_2">Later History</h2>
<p>The Walery studio later opened branches in London and Nice, further cementing its reputation as a premier photography establishment. After Stanisław Julian Ostroróg&rsquo;s death in 1890, his son, Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg (1863-1929), continued using the Walery name and became known for photographing theater and cabaret stars, including the famous dancer Mata Hari.</p>
<p>The younger Walery&rsquo;s photographs of the Folies Bergère and other Parisian entertainment venues created iconic images of the Belle Époque era. The Walery studio&rsquo;s photographs now serve as important historical documents of late 19th and early 20th century theatrical and social life.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_20">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>August 26, 1873</strong>: Marie visits the Walery studio in Paris and views photographs of Gioia</li>
<li><strong>September 4, 1873</strong>: Marie receives her portrait photographs from Walery and critiques them, finding the poses &ldquo;affected&rdquo; and commenting that her hair arrangement gives &ldquo;de la vulgarité&rdquo; (vulgarity)</li>

<h2 id="walitsky"><a href="../Walitsky.md">Walitsky</a></h2>
<h1 id="walitsky-walitzky">Walitsky (Walitzky)</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_17">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Walitsky was a family friend or associate of the Bashkirtseffs in Nice during 1873. He appears to have had some social connections with the Duke of Hamilton and served as an intermediary figure between Marie&rsquo;s family and wider Nice society. His name is sometimes spelled &ldquo;Walitzky&rdquo; in the diary.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_14">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Walitsky played several important roles:
- <strong>Hamilton Connection</strong>: Promised to bring the Duke of Hamilton to visit (&ldquo;cet hiver j&rsquo;amènerai Hamilton&rdquo;)
- <strong>Source of Information</strong>: Shared stories and made jokes about Hamilton
- <strong>Family Friend</strong>: Participated in family activities and discussions
- <strong>Authority Figure</strong>: Involved in disciplining the servant Palajka</p>
<p>His promise to bring Hamilton to visit had a dramatic effect on Marie&rsquo;s mood, transforming her from tears to joy in an instant.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_85">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In 19th-century expatriate society, well-connected individuals who could facilitate introductions were highly valued. Walitsky appears to have moved in the same social circles as Hamilton and could therefore serve as a potential bridge between Marie&rsquo;s family and the Duke.</p>

<h2 id="overview_58">Overview</h2>
<p>Wittgenstein appears in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as a member of the aristocratic society in Nice during 1873. The family owned a villa in Nice and was part of the international high society that wintered on the French Riviera.</p>
<h2 id="key-appearances_4">Key Appearances</h2>
<h3 id="october-15-1873">October 15, 1873</h3>
<p>During Marie&rsquo;s emotional crisis following news of Hamilton&rsquo;s engagement, she notes: &ldquo;Point de Gioia&hellip; Point de Wittgenstein; partis!&rdquo; (No Gioia&hellip; No Wittgenstein; gone!). This suggests Wittgenstein left Nice around the same time as Gioia, possibly indicating they were connected or traveled in the same social circles.</p>
<h3 id="april-1874">April 1874</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 20</strong>: Marie observes &ldquo;En descendant la rue nous croisâmes la voiture du prince de Wittgenstein dans laquelle il était avec une belle dame qui sans doute est sa fille.&rdquo; Notes the prince looks around 50 years old.</li>
<li><strong>April 29</strong>: Regular horseback rider: &ldquo;Toutes les fois que le prince de Wittgenstein monte à cheval nous le voyons rentrer chez lui vers six heures, galopant.&rdquo; Marie sees only his back on grey horse. His presence makes her &ldquo;rêveuse et fantastique.&rdquo; She observes: &ldquo;J&rsquo;ai vu aujourd&rsquo;hui son dos, c&rsquo;est la partie que j&rsquo;aime le mieux en lui. Il tient la face et les yeux baissés. Sur ce cheval il paraît énorme.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-position_8">Social Position</h3>
<p>The Wittgenstein mentioned is likely a member of the prominent European noble family. The Wittgensteins were:
- <strong>Austrian or German nobility</strong>: The family had branches in both empires
- <strong>Wealthy industrialists</strong>: Known for their business enterprises
- <strong>Cultural patrons</strong>: Supported arts and music
- <strong>International society</strong>: Maintained residences in multiple European cities</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-nice-society">Connection to Nice Society</h2>
<p>The Wittgensteins in Nice:
- Owned a villa (referenced as staying at their property)
- Part of the international winter colony
- Connected to other prominent figures like Gioia
- Their departure marked a change in the social season</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-maries-circle_1">Relationship to Marie&rsquo;s Circle</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social peer</strong>: Part of the same aristocratic circles</li>
<li><strong>Gioia connection</strong>: Their simultaneous departure suggests association</li>
<li><strong>Hamilton orbit</strong>: As part of Nice high society, likely knew the Duke</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="historical-context_87">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Nice in the 1870s was a favorite wintering spot for European aristocracy. Families like the Wittgensteins would:
- Spend winters in Nice for the climate
- Maintain villas or rent prestigious properties
- Participate in the social season
- Form an international community of nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie</p>
<h2 id="possible-identity">Possible Identity</h2>
<p>This could be a member of the prominent Wittgenstein family that later produced the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (born 1889). The family was already established in high society by the 1870s through their industrial wealth and cultural connections.</p>
<h2 id="questions-for-further-research_13">Questions for Further Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Which specific Wittgenstein family member was in Nice in 1873?</li>
<li>What was their connection to Gioia?</li>
<li>Did they own or rent their Nice property?</li>
<li>Were they Austrian or German Wittgensteins?</li>
