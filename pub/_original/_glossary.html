<h2 id="duke_of_hamilton">Duke_of_Hamilton</h2>
<h1 id="duke-of-hamilton">Duke of Hamilton</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information">Basic Information</h2>
<p>William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845–1895), was a Scottish nobleman and a significant figure in British aristocratic circles during the late 19th century. He held multiple titles including Duke of Hamilton and Duke of Brandon, and was the Premier Peer of Scotland.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>The Duke of Hamilton features prominently in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as the object of her intense infatuation during 1873. Despite having no actual relationship with him, Marie developed a deep romantic fixation on the Duke after seeing him in Nice. Her diary entries from August 1873 reveal her excitement at potentially seeing him in Paris and her conflicted feelings about her attraction to him.</p>
<p>On August 19, 1873, Marie engages in introspection about whether she truly loves the Duke or if it&rsquo;s merely her imagination. Her emotional reactions to not seeing him during her Paris visit, and her dramatic statement that she would &ldquo;go to China just to see him pass by,&rdquo; reveal the depth of her infatuation.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s obsession with the Duke represents her romantic idealism and her aspirations to move in the highest circles of European aristocracy. Her fixation on him also reveals her emotional intensity and tendency toward melodramatic imagination.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>In 1873, the Duke of Hamilton was 28 years old and would marry Lady Mary Montagu later that same year (on July 10, 1873). He was known for his aristocratic lifestyle and passion for horse racing, though his financial difficulties were significant despite inheriting vast estates.</p>
<p>His horse Cortolvin had won the Grand National Steeplechase in 1867, but by 1873, his racing fortunes had apparently declined. Marie mentions in her diary that he is &ldquo;reduced to a single horse instead of five&rdquo; and &ldquo;for three years he has fallen in the races, arriving only third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke had significant family connections to European royalty. His mother, Princess Marie Amelie of Baden, was the sister of the Grand Duke of Baden, who was married to the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm I of Prussia. This made the Duke of Hamilton a nephew by marriage to the Prussian royal family.</p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later Life</h2>
<p>The Duke&rsquo;s marriage to Lady Mary Montagu produced one daughter, Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. His later years were marked by declining health and financial difficulties. He died in 1895 at the age of 50, with his titles passing to his cousin Alfred Douglas Douglas-Hamilton.</p>

<li><strong>August 18-19, 1873</strong>: Marie expresses excitement at potentially seeing the Duke in Paris</li>
<li><strong>August 19, 1873</strong>: She reflects on whether she truly loves him or if it&rsquo;s merely her imagination</li>

<h2 id="emile_zola">Emile_Zola</h2>
<h1 id="emile-zola">Émile Zola</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_1">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (1840-1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, and a major figure in the literary school of naturalism. He was also an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_1">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff was familiar with Zola&rsquo;s work and the naturalist movement. Her diary itself has been considered a &ldquo;document humain&rdquo; (human document), a term popularized by naturalist writers like Zola. The raw honesty and detailed observations in Marie&rsquo;s diary align with the naturalist approach to documenting human experience.</p>
<p>Zola&rsquo;s emphasis on detailed documentation of everyday life and his belief in literature as a scientific study of human behavior resonated with Marie&rsquo;s own approach to her diary writing. Though they never met personally, Marie was part of the artistic and literary circles in Paris where Zola&rsquo;s influence was significant.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_1">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Zola was born in Paris in 1840 and became one of the most influential writers of the late 19th century. He is known for his 20-novel series <em>Les Rougon-Macquart</em>, which follows two branches of a family during the Second French Empire.</p>
<p>As a prominent figure in the naturalist movement, Zola believed in the objective study of human behavior through literature. His works often depicted the harsh realities of working-class life and tackled controversial social issues.</p>
<p>Zola was also known for his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, publishing the famous open letter &ldquo;J&rsquo;Accuse…!&rdquo; in 1898, which accused the French government of antisemitism in the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus.</p>
<h2 id="literary-influence">Literary Influence</h2>
<p>Zola&rsquo;s naturalist approach emphasized:
- Detailed observation and documentation of reality
- Scientific objectivity in portraying human behavior
- Focus on the influence of heredity and environment on character
- Unflinching portrayal of all aspects of life, including the sordid and unpleasant</p>
<p>These principles influenced many writers of Marie&rsquo;s era, including the way personal accounts and diaries were valued as authentic &ldquo;human documents.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="notable-works">Notable Works</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Thérèse Raquin</em> (1867)</li>
<li><em>L&rsquo;Assommoir</em> (1877) - about alcoholism and poverty in working-class Paris</li>
<li><em>Nana</em> (1880) - about a prostitute</li>
<li><em>Germinal</em> (1885) - about a coal miners&rsquo; strike</li>
<li><em>J&rsquo;Accuse…!</em> (1898) - open letter on the Dreyfus Affair</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_1">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>While direct mentions of Zola in Marie&rsquo;s diary are limited, his influence on the literary and artistic culture of her time was significant. Marie&rsquo;s own artistic aspirations and her desire to document her life in detail show parallels with the naturalist movement that Zola championed.</p>
<h2 id="gioia">Gioia</h2>
<h1 id="gioia-amelia">Gioia (Amélia)</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_2">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Gioia (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Madame Amélia&rdquo; in Marie&rsquo;s diary) was a beautiful woman who was the mistress of William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton. She appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary as an object of both admiration and jealousy, representing Marie&rsquo;s complex feelings about beauty, social status, and romantic rivalry.</p>
<p>Marie first mentions Gioia in her diary entries from January 1873, when she observes the Duke visiting Gioia in Nice. Throughout her diary, Marie refers to Gioia using various nicknames, including &ldquo;Laïs&rdquo; (after a famous Greek courtesan) and &ldquo;Centifolia&rdquo; (a type of rose), indicating both her fascination with and objectification of this woman.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_2">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Gioia represents both an ideal of feminine beauty for Marie and a painful reminder of her unrequited love for the Duke of Hamilton. Marie&rsquo;s diary entries reveal her complex and contradictory feelings toward Gioia:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admiration</strong>: Marie frequently describes Gioia as &ldquo;sublime,&rdquo; &ldquo;perfect,&rdquo; and &ldquo;beautiful like an angel,&rdquo; considering her the &ldquo;perfection, the ideal, the divinity of woman&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Jealousy</strong>: She expresses envy of Gioia&rsquo;s relationship with the Duke and her physical attributes</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong>: Marie is flattered when others suggest she resembles Gioia, and she sometimes imitates Gioia&rsquo;s hairstyle</li>
<li><strong>Obsession</strong>: She goes out of her way to see Gioia during promenades, sometimes following her or changing routes to encounter her</li>
</ul>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s encounter with Gioia&rsquo;s portrait at the Walery photography studio on August 26, 1873, had a particularly profound emotional impact. Her repeated viewing of Gioia&rsquo;s photographs and her comparison of herself to this beautiful woman demonstrates her complex emotions about beauty and romantic rivalry.</p>
<h2 id="physical-appearance-and-lifestyle">Physical Appearance and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>From Marie&rsquo;s descriptions, we learn that Gioia was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tall with a &ldquo;majestic&rdquo; bearing and elegant manners</li>
<li>Known for her beauty, though Marie notes she wore heavy makeup (&ldquo;fardée comme un meunier&rdquo; - &ldquo;made up like a miller&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Fashionable, with Marie describing her various outfits in detail</li>
<li>Living in a luxurious villa on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice</li>
<li>Wealthy enough to maintain a carriage, servants, and expensive clothing</li>
<li>The mother of a son, who Marie mentions was not the Duke&rsquo;s child</li>
</ul>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diary provides glimpses of Gioia&rsquo;s lifestyle, including her home (which had a &ldquo;salon gris et cerise&rdquo; - gray and cherry-colored salon), her social activities, and her relationships. After the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s marriage to Lady Mary Montagu in July 1873, Gioia appears to have left Nice temporarily, with Marie noting that her house was being renovated or redecorated in late 1873, suggesting her return.</p>
<h2 id="later-developments">Later Developments</h2>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diary entries from late 1873 and early 1874 suggest that Gioia&rsquo;s circumstances changed after the Duke&rsquo;s marriage. She mentions Gioia appearing in a rented landau rather than her own carriage, which Marie interprets as a sign of reduced circumstances. She also records gossip about Gioia&rsquo;s financial difficulties and her relationships with other men, including Count Lambertye and someone named Krassowsky.</p>
<p>By December 1873, Marie notes that Gioia had returned to Nice and appeared at the theater &ldquo;in velvet black, old laces and diamonds.&rdquo; She also mentions a New Year&rsquo;s Eve scandal involving Gioia, Krassowsky, and another woman named Soubise at the Cercle de la Méditerranée (a social club in Nice).</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-the-diary_2">Mentions in the Diary</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Gioia extensively throughout her diary from January 1873 to early 1874. Key entries include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January 19, 1873</strong>: First mention of Gioia, when Marie sees the Duke visiting her</li>
<li><strong>January 30, 1873</strong>: Marie sees Gioia in a closed carriage with a man who is not the Duke</li>
<li><strong>February 7, 1873</strong>: Marie expresses her belief that the Duke is &ldquo;too occupied with Gioia&rdquo; to notice her</li>
<li><strong>February 9, 1873</strong>: Marie admits that Gioia is &ldquo;beautiful, more beautiful than me&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>August 25, 1873</strong>: Marie sees Gioia&rsquo;s portrait and has an intense emotional reaction</li>
<li><strong>August 26, 1873</strong>: Marie visits the Walery studio and repeatedly views photographs of Gioia</li>
<li><strong>December 1873</strong>: Marie notes Gioia&rsquo;s return to Nice and her appearance at the theater</li>
<li><strong>January 1, 1874</strong>: References to a scandal involving Gioia at the Cercle de la Méditerranée</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="house_of_worth">House_of_Worth</h2>
<h1 id="house-of-worth">House of Worth</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_3">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The House of Worth was a French haute couture fashion house founded by English designer Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895) in Paris in 1858. Located at 7 Rue de la Paix, it was the premier fashion house in Paris during the Second Empire and Belle Époque periods, essentially creating the concept of haute couture as we understand it today.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_3">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s diary entries from August 1873 reveal her fascination with the House of Worth and her desire to own garments from this prestigious establishment. During her visit to Paris, she mentions visiting Worth multiple times, including a morning visit on August 27 to order a dress before her departure.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s detailed descriptions of Worth dresses and their prices (700-1900 francs) demonstrate both the substantial cost of haute couture and her own social aspirations. Her preference for her Worth dress over creations from other fashion houses like Laferrière reflects Worth&rsquo;s superior status in the fashion hierarchy of the time.</p>
<p>For Marie, wearing Worth creations was not merely about fashion but about establishing her position in high society. Her willingness to spend significant sums on Worth garments, despite financial constraints, reveals the importance she placed on appearance and material display in the social world she inhabited and aspired to conquer.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_2">Historical Context</h2>
<p>By 1873, when Marie visited the establishment, the House of Worth was at the height of its influence and prestige. Charles Frederick Worth had revolutionized the fashion industry by transforming the traditional dressmaker into a fashion designer in the modern sense.</p>
<p>Worth pioneered many practices that became standard in the fashion industry:
- Using live models to present seasonal collections to clients
- Creating a brand identity and attaching his label to garments
- Presenting clients with designs to choose from rather than following their specifications
- Creating seasonal collections with new designs</p>
<p>The House of Worth dressed European royalty, including Empress Eugénie of France, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and Queen Victoria, as well as wealthy Americans and prominent figures from around the world. Worth&rsquo;s designs were characterized by rich fabrics such as silk, velvet, and satin, often incorporating multiple fabrics in a single garment with elaborate trimmings including lace, beading, and embroidery.</p>
<p>In 1873, Worth&rsquo;s designs featured elaborate bustle silhouettes that had replaced the earlier crinoline styles of the 1860s. The silhouette was characterized by a tight-fitting bodice and a skirt that projected at the back, supported by a bustle.</p>
<h2 id="later-history">Later History</h2>
<p>After Charles Frederick Worth&rsquo;s death in 1895, his sons Gaston-Lucien (1853-1924) and Jean-Philippe (1856-1926) continued the business. The House of Worth remained influential into the early 20th century but gradually declined in prominence with changing fashion trends after World War I. The house finally closed in 1952, though the Worth name was revived in 1999 for a perfume line.</p>

<h2 id="le_bon_marche">Le_Bon_Marche</h2>
<h1 id="le-bon-marche">Le Bon Marché</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_4">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Le Bon Marché was the first modern department store in Paris and a pioneering institution in retail history. Founded in 1838 as a small haberdashery by Aristide Boucicaut and his wife Marguerite, it underwent significant expansion in the early 1870s to become a revolutionary shopping destination. By 1873, when Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris, Le Bon Marché had recently been expanded with the help of Gustave Eiffel&rsquo;s engineering firm and featured 22 departments across multiple floors with wide, open interiors.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_4">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie mentions Le Bon Marché in her diary during her Paris visit in August 1873. Her cousin Dina suggested visiting the store, but Marie dismissed the idea, considering it beneath her social standing. Marie&rsquo;s diary entry notes that she considered shopping at Le Bon Marché as reflecting &ldquo;vulgaire&rdquo; tastes, which reveals her aristocratic aspirations and social snobbery.</p>
<p>This attitude toward department stores versus exclusive boutiques and fashion houses like Worth and Laferrière demonstrates Marie&rsquo;s preoccupation with social status and her desire to associate herself with the highest echelons of society. Despite the store&rsquo;s growing popularity and innovative retail concepts, Marie preferred the exclusive experience of haute couture establishments and specialized boutiques.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_3">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Le Bon Marché revolutionized retail in the 19th century by introducing several innovations that define modern department stores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed pricing (replacing the traditional haggling system)</li>
<li>The ability to browse freely without obligation to buy</li>
<li>A wide variety of goods under one roof</li>
<li>Seasonal sales and special promotions</li>
<li>Money-back guarantees</li>
<li>Home delivery services</li>
</ul>
<p>The store catered particularly to women of the growing middle class, offering them a respectable public space to shop independently. By the 1870s, Le Bon Marché had become not just a shopping destination but a social institution and tourist attraction.</p>
<p>The 1870s expansion, completed in 1872, transformed the store into an architectural marvel with iron and glass construction, grand staircases, and a light-filled central hall. The Boucicauts also introduced innovative employee benefits including profit-sharing, pension plans, free medical care, and educational opportunities for staff.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s dismissal of Le Bon Marché reflects a common attitude among the aristocracy and those with aristocratic aspirations, who often viewed department stores as catering to the bourgeoisie despite the fact that these establishments were transforming consumer culture across all social classes.</p>
<h2 id="later-history_1">Later History</h2>
<p>Le Bon Marché continued to thrive and expand in the decades following Marie&rsquo;s visit. In 1887, it moved to its current location on the Left Bank of Paris, in a building designed by Louis-Charles Boileau and Gustave Eiffel. The store survived both World Wars and remains in operation today as an upscale department store owned by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.</p>

<h1 id="paris-in-the-1870s">Paris in the 1870s</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_5">Basic Information</h2>
<p>Paris in the 1870s was a city in transition, recovering from the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune uprising (1871) while reestablishing itself as the cultural and fashion capital of Europe. The early 1870s marked the beginning of the Third Republic in France, a period of political reorganization following the fall of Napoleon III&rsquo;s Second Empire.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_5">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris in August 1873 and developed a deep admiration for the city. Her diary entries reveal her enthusiasm for Paris as the cultural and fashion capital of the world. She writes passionately about the city&rsquo;s atmosphere, the quality of the people she sees, and her desire to eventually move there from Nice.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;Tous les endroits sont égaux pour moi excepté Paris que j&rsquo;adore et Nice que j&rsquo;abhorre&rdquo; (All places are equal to me except Paris, which I adore, and Nice, which I abhor) reveals her strong preference for the cultural and social opportunities of Paris over the provincial atmosphere of Nice.</p>
<p>For Marie, Paris represented opportunity, sophistication, and the possibility of achieving her artistic and social ambitions. Her shopping experiences at prestigious establishments like the House of Worth, her visits to cultural venues, and her observations of Parisian society all reinforced her desire to establish herself in this cosmopolitan environment.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_4">Historical Context</h2>
<p>Paris in 1873 was in a period of recovery and transformation. The city had suffered significant damage during the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent Paris Commune uprising. The siege of Paris (September 1870 to January 1871) had caused severe hardship, and the violent suppression of the Commune in May 1871 had resulted in thousands of deaths and the destruction of numerous buildings.</p>
<p>By 1873, reconstruction efforts were underway, guided by urban planner Baron Haussmann&rsquo;s earlier vision of a modern city with wide boulevards, grand public spaces, and improved infrastructure. The Third Republic, established in 1870, was still consolidating its political structures, with monarchist factions maintaining significant influence in the early 1870s.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Paris was regaining its position as a center of culture, fashion, and society. The city&rsquo;s theaters, opera houses, and other cultural venues were active, and its fashion houses, including the House of Worth, continued to set international trends. The Parisian elite maintained their social rituals, including promenades in the Bois de Boulogne and attendance at the opera and theater.</p>

<h2 id="vienna_world_exhibition">Vienna_World_Exhibition</h2>
<h1 id="vienna-world-exhibition-of-1873">Vienna World Exhibition of 1873</h1>
<h2 id="basic-information_6">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The Vienna World Exhibition (Weltausstellung 1873 Wien) was held from May 1 to November 2, 1873, in the Austro-Hungarian capital. It was the fifth world exposition and the first to be held in a German-speaking country. The exhibition was designed to showcase industrial, cultural, and scientific achievements from around the world and coincided with Emperor Franz Joseph I&rsquo;s 25th anniversary as ruler.</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_6">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie visited the Vienna World Exhibition during her stay in Vienna in August 1873. In her diary entries from August 11-15, 1873, she mentions visiting the &ldquo;Exposition&rdquo; several times. On August 13, she specifically notes visiting the &ldquo;Agrikulturhalle&rdquo; (Agricultural Hall) where she found her father&rsquo;s tobacco on display. She also mentions seeing Lefèvre&rsquo;s wine.</p>
<p>Her visits to the exhibition represent her family&rsquo;s participation in elite cultural events and their connections to European high society. The fact that her father&rsquo;s tobacco was displayed at the exhibition also indicates the family&rsquo;s economic interests and status.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_5">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The Vienna World Exhibition faced significant challenges, including the stock market crash of May 1873 (part of the global &ldquo;Panic of 1873&rdquo;) and a concurrent cholera epidemic, which severely impacted attendance. This may explain Marie&rsquo;s mention of her aunt&rsquo;s fear of cholera when Marie became ill on August 14.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the fair was the Rotunda, the world&rsquo;s largest domed building at the time, surrounded by themed halls including the Palace of Industry and the Hall of Engines. National exhibits showcased both technological innovation and traditional arts, emphasizing cultural pride.</p>
<p>The exhibition aimed to elevate Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s status among major European powers like France and Britain. Despite financial difficulties and lower-than-expected attendance (about 7 million visitors compared to the projected 20 million), the exhibition succeeded in showcasing Vienna as a cultural and technological center.</p>

<h2 id="basic-information_7">Basic Information</h2>
<p>The Walery photography studio was a prestigious portrait photography establishment in Paris during the late 19th century. It was founded by Count Stanisław Julian Ostroróg (1830-1890), a Polish nobleman who fled to France after participating in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He established the studio under the name &ldquo;Walery&rdquo; (derived from his wife&rsquo;s name, Waleria).</p>
<h2 id="significance-in-marie-bashkirtseffs-life_7">Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff visited the Walery studio on August 26, 1873, during her stay in Paris. Her diary entry about this visit provides valuable insights into both the world of high-end portrait photography in 1870s Paris and Marie&rsquo;s own emotional state.</p>
<p>At the studio, Marie was particularly fixated on viewing portraits of Gioia, a beautiful woman connected to the Duke of Hamilton (the object of Marie&rsquo;s infatuation). Marie&rsquo;s repeated viewing of Gioia&rsquo;s photographs and comparison of herself to this beautiful woman reveals her insecurities about her own appearance and attractiveness.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s desire to have her portrait taken at Walery reflects both the studio&rsquo;s growing reputation as a fashionable establishment and her own social aspirations. Her visit to this prestigious studio aligns with her broader efforts to establish herself in Parisian high society through association with elite establishments.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context_6">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The Walery studio at 9 Rue de Londres in Paris had been established around 1871-1872, making it relatively new but already fashionable when Marie visited in 1873. The studio quickly gained fame for its portraits of celebrities, aristocrats, and beautiful women of the era.</p>
<p>Walery specialized in theatrical photography and portraits of opera singers, actresses, and other performers, which explains why Marie saw portraits of Gioia there. By 1873, the studio was becoming one of the most fashionable photography establishments in Paris, attracting clients from high society.</p>
<p>Walery&rsquo;s portraits were characterized by their dramatic lighting, elegant poses, and attention to detail. The photographs were often distributed as cabinet cards and cartes de visite, which were popular collectibles among the upper classes.</p>
<h2 id="later-history_2">Later History</h2>
<p>The Walery studio later opened branches in London and Nice, further cementing its reputation as a premier photography establishment. After Stanisław Julian Ostroróg&rsquo;s death in 1890, his son, Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg (1863-1929), continued using the Walery name and became known for photographing theater and cabaret stars, including the famous dancer Mata Hari.</p>
<p>The younger Walery&rsquo;s photographs of the Folies Bergère and other Parisian entertainment venues created iconic images of the Belle Époque era. The Walery studio&rsquo;s photographs now serve as important historical documents of late 19th and early 20th century theatrical and social life.</p>
