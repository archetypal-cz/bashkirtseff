<h2 id="overview_1">Overview</h2>
<p>The March 1873 entries (1st-12th) conclude Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s second notebook (Carnet N° 2).

<h3 id="the-departure-of-the-duke">The Departure of the Duke</h3>
<p>Early in March, Marie learns that the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s yacht has left Nice eight days earlier, meaning he has departed without her ever having been properly introduced to him. This news devastates her:

<h2 id="year-end-reflection">Year-End Reflection</h2>
<p>The diary for 1873 ends with Marie:
- Still completely obsessed with Hamilton
- Physically and emotionally damaged by the experience
- Beginning 1874 with Hamilton&rsquo;s photograph before her
- Writing wishes for a &ldquo;richissime duc anglais&rdquo; at midnight
- Ending with &ldquo;Ah le duc de Hamilton comme il me plaisait-plaît&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="connections-to-overall-narrative">Connections to Overall Narrative</h2>
<p>December 1873 represents both an ending and a beginning. The marriage ends Marie&rsquo;s active hope of winning Hamilton but begins a new phase of her emotional development. The intensity of her suffering over what was essentially a one-sided infatuation reveals both the constraints of her social position and the depth of her emotional capacity. This experience would influence her approach to future relationships and her understanding of her place in society.</p>
