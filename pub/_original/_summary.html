<p>February 1873 marks the beginning of Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s second notebook (Carnet N° 2). During this month, Marie is living in Nice with her family, participating in the winter social season that attracted wealthy European and Russian aristocrats to the French Riviera.

<p>February 1873 captures the winter social season in Nice, when wealthy Europeans and Russians would escape the northern winter for the mild Mediterranean climate. The carnival season was a major social event, with elaborate festivities leading up to Mardi Gras. Marie&rsquo;s diary provides a window into the social life, values, and preoccupations of a young aristocratic woman in this setting.</p>
<h2 id="1873-03">1873-03</h2>
<p>The March 1873 entries (1st-12th) conclude Marie Bashkirtseff&rsquo;s second notebook (Carnet N° 2). This period marks a significant transition in Marie&rsquo;s life as she learns that the Duke of Hamilton has departed Nice, forcing her to reconsider her romantic aspirations. The month also features a pivotal moment when Marie discovers her singing talent might provide a path to fame and the Duke&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Early in March, Marie learns that the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s yacht has left Nice eight days earlier, meaning he has departed without her ever having been properly introduced to him. This news devastates her:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She expresses rage and despair at being &ldquo;ignored&rdquo; by him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laments having no purpose for her promenades and social appearances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagines him in Paris, planning to somehow see him there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compares her feelings to those for someone who has died</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A transformative moment occurs on March 9 when Marie sings for the Howard children and receives enthusiastic praise. This experience leads to an epiphany:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She realizes her voice could make her a celebrated singer (cantatrice)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Envisions a career that would bring her fame, admiration, and social power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believes this path could ultimately win the Duke&rsquo;s attention and love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sees this as divinely inspired - God showing her how to achieve her desires</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconciles her aristocratic status with a performing career by emphasizing her noble birth</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s feelings about Boreel remain complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Expresses disappointment at his visits to Monaco and rumors of his behavior there</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>By the following day, her mother is improving but still bedridden</p>

<p>The September entries continue themes established in August, particularly Marie&rsquo;s return to Nice and her ongoing infatuation with the Duke of Hamilton. Her resumption of studies fulfills the plans mentioned at the end of August. The family&rsquo;s teasing about the Duke, which began upon her return to Nice in late August, continues throughout early September.

<p>December 1873 represents both an ending and a beginning. The marriage ends Marie&rsquo;s active hope of winning Hamilton but begins a new phase of her emotional development. The intensity of her suffering over what was essentially a one-sided infatuation reveals both the constraints of her social position and the depth of her emotional capacity. This experience would influence her approach to future relationships and her understanding of her place in society.</p>
