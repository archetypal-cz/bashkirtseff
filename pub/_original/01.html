<li id="fn:01.13.1">
<p>The Russian New Year was celebrated on January 13th according to the Gregorian calendar used in Western Europe, due to Russia&rsquo;s use of the Julian calendar at that time.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.13.1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.16.1">
<p>The Floréal balls were significant social events in Nice during the winter season, attended by both local aristocracy and wealthy visitors.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.16.1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.20.1">
<p>The Cercle Masséna was named after André Masséna, one of Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals who was born in Nice. It was an important social institution where the local aristocracy and wealthy visitors gathered for balls, concerts, and other cultural events.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.20.1" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.23.1">
<p>Mlle Collignon was Marie&rsquo;s English governess who played a significant role in her education and social development. Her presence in these entries reflects the typical arrangement for young ladies of Marie&rsquo;s social class, who were educated by private governesses.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.23.1" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.25.1">
<p>The public gardens (&ldquo;jardins publics&rdquo;) were a central feature of Nice&rsquo;s social life, where the wealthy would promenade to see and be seen, even in inclement weather.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.25.1" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.34.1">
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff was born on November 11, 1858. The January 24 date she mentions here was likely her name day celebration according to the Russian Orthodox calendar, which was common practice among Russian nobility.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.34.1" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.46.1">
<p>This passage shows remarkable self-awareness for a thirteen-year-old, suggesting either precocious maturity or later editing of her diary entries. The Duke of Hamilton was indeed known for his sporting interests and social life.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.46.1" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.52.1">
<p>The Wittgenstein mentioned here was likely a member of the prominent European aristocratic family, showing the social circles in which the Duke moved.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.52.1" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.54.1">
<p>Horse racing was a major social event on the French Riviera during the winter season, attracting wealthy British visitors like the Duke of Hamilton.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.54.1" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.56.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s English lessons with Mlle Collignon had begun on January 12, 1872, as noted in a previous entry. This consistent study would later enable her to write parts of her diary in English.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.56.1" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.59.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s strategic analysis of romantic relationships was unusually sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old, suggesting either remarkable precocity or later editing of her diary entries.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.59.1" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.70.1">
<p>This 1884 annotation (&ldquo;Stupidité, ingénuité&rdquo;) was added by Marie herself eleven years later, when she was reviewing her earlier diaries. Such later comments provide valuable insight into how she viewed her younger self&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.70.1" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.72.1">
<p>The races were major social events in Nice&rsquo;s winter season, providing opportunities for the local society to gather and display their status. For Marie, they represented a chance to see the Duke in a public setting where her presence would be socially acceptable.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.72.1" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.77.1">
<p>The Howards and Prince Gagarine were prominent figures in Nice&rsquo;s international society. Marie&rsquo;s casual betting of bonbons shows both her youth and her participation in adult social customs.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.77.1" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.78.1">
<p>The position of race commissioner was a prestigious role typically held by prominent members of society, highlighting the Duke&rsquo;s social status.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.78.1" title="Jump back to footnote 15 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.88.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s diaries did indeed become important literary documents, though valued more for their psychological insight and social history than as stylistic models. Her self-awareness about her early literary pretensions shows remarkable maturity.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.88.1" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.90.1">
<p>The pigeon shooting competitions in Monaco were prestigious events that attracted international aristocracy. Being &ldquo;mis hors concours&rdquo; meant the Duke was excluded from the competition, possibly due to his previous victories or his status as a patron.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.90.1" title="Jump back to footnote 17 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.98.1">
<p>The Cercle de la Méditerranée was one of Nice&rsquo;s most prestigious social venues. The Vicomtesse Vigier, who hosted this performance, was the former opera singer Sophie Cruvelli, adding another layer of significance to the musical evening.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.98.1" title="Jump back to footnote 18 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.99.1">
<p>Bellini&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Sonnambula&rdquo; (The Sleepwalker) was a popular romantic opera, its themes of love, misunderstanding, and eventual recognition perhaps resonating with Marie&rsquo;s own romantic hopes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.99.1" title="Jump back to footnote 19 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.103.1">
<p>The reference to Baden (&ldquo;Bade&rdquo;) indicates that Marie had seen the Duke before her time in Nice, establishing a longer history to her fascination with him.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.103.1" title="Jump back to footnote 20 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.115.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s ability to simultaneously experience intense emotions and analyze them with some detachment is remarkable for a thirteen-year-old, though this sophistication has led some scholars to question whether she later edited these early diary entries.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.115.1" title="Jump back to footnote 21 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.120.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s ability to acknowledge Gioia&rsquo;s superior beauty, despite her jealousy, demonstrates a level of honesty in her diary-keeping that would later make these journals valuable historical documents.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.120.1" title="Jump back to footnote 22 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.123.1">
<p>The mention of Baron Bach illustrates how Russian aristocratic families sought suitable marriages for their children while wintering on the French Riviera.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.123.1" title="Jump back to footnote 23 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.125.1">
<p>The contrast between the death of Madame U. and Marie&rsquo;s preoccupation with missing the Duke illustrates the sometimes jarring juxtaposition of serious social events with adolescent concerns in her diary.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.125.1" title="Jump back to footnote 24 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.128.1">
<p>The regatta was another significant social event in Nice&rsquo;s winter season, attracting international visitors and providing opportunities for social display.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.128.1" title="Jump back to footnote 25 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.136.1">
<p>The presence of a &ldquo;jolie Ecossaise&rdquo; (pretty Scottish girl) at the ball indicates the international character of Nice&rsquo;s winter society, which attracted wealthy families from across Europe.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.136.1" title="Jump back to footnote 26 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.147.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s observation about people criticizing those they secretly admire shows psychological insight that seems beyond her years, though it may reflect later editing or naturally precocious understanding of human nature.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.147.1" title="Jump back to footnote 27 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.145.1">
<p>The comparison of the Duke to a butcher by Hélène provides a rare glimpse of how others viewed him, contrasting sharply with Marie&rsquo;s idealized perception.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.145.1" title="Jump back to footnote 28 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:01.148.1">
<p>Marie&rsquo;s language studies with Mlle Collignon (English) and Micaletti (Italian) reflect both her privileged education and her cosmopolitan upbringing. Her satisfaction with her progress suggests she took her studies seriously despite her romantic preoccupations.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:01.148.1" title="Jump back to footnote 29 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
