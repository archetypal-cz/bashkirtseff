## Bensa

# Bensa

## Overview

Bensa was one of Marie Bashkirtseff's teachers in Nice during 1873. Based on diary entries, he appears to have been responsible for arranging other professors for Marie's extensive educational program and also taught her directly.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie first mentions Bensa in her September 1873 diary entries. In the September 9 entry (not yet processed), she refers to him as "one of Marie's teachers who arranges for other professors."

In the September 17, 1873 entry, Marie describes an amusing interaction with Bensa:

> "Mais quelle *riaille* [sic] nous eûmes avec Bensa ! Ce pauvre homme est si drôle ! Dina et moi nous amusons à ne pas le comprendre ou bien lorsqu'il raconte des choses extraordinaires ne pas nous étonner ou encore nier ce qu'on a dit et prouver qu'il fait nuit à midi. Quelque temps il discute, mais enfin il commence à danser, secouer ses mains et ne pousse que des soupirs et des espèces de gémissements: - Ah ! Mlle Dina ! ah ! Mlle Marie !"

This passage reveals that Marie and her cousin Dina would tease Bensa by pretending not to understand him, refusing to be impressed by his "extraordinary things," and arguing absurdities like "proving it's night at noon." Bensa's exasperated reaction - dancing, shaking his hands, and sighing "Ah! Mlle Dina! ah! Mlle Marie!" - shows how they successfully provoked him.

In the same entry, Marie mentions trying to convince Bensa that "the head of Nero is more beautiful than that of Apollo," suggesting that he may have been teaching her about classical art or history.

In the September 19 entry, Marie mentions that Bensa had commented on Gioia's hair: "Bensa en a parlé: j'ai vu cette bel/eu [sic] dame avec de beaux cheveux" (Bensa spoke of it: I saw this beautiful lady with beautiful hair).

## Character and Role

Based on Marie's descriptions, Bensa appears to have been:

1. A somewhat excitable or emotional teacher who could be easily provoked by his students' teasing
2. Someone who arranged for other professors in Marie's educational program
3. Possibly a teacher of art, history, or classical studies
4. Someone who moved in Nice society and was familiar with figures like Gioia

Marie's playful interactions with him suggest she felt comfortable enough to tease him, indicating a less formal teacher-student relationship than might have been typical for the time.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, young women of Marie's social class would typically receive education from private tutors rather than attending schools. Marie's educational program was unusually extensive for a young woman of her time, including multiple languages, sciences, music, and art. Teachers like Bensa would have been hired by wealthy families to provide this private education.

## Duke_of_Hamilton

# Duke of Hamilton

## Basic Information

William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845–1895), was a Scottish nobleman and a significant figure in British aristocratic circles during the late 19th century. He held multiple titles including Duke of Hamilton and Duke of Brandon, and was the Premier Peer of Scotland.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

The Duke of Hamilton features prominently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as the object of her intense infatuation during 1873. Despite having no actual relationship with him, Marie developed a deep romantic fixation on the Duke after seeing him in Nice. Her diary entries from August 1873 reveal her excitement at potentially seeing him in Paris and her conflicted feelings about her attraction to him.

On August 19, 1873, Marie engages in introspection about whether she truly loves the Duke or if it's merely her imagination. Her emotional reactions to not seeing him during her Paris visit, and her dramatic statement that she would "go to China just to see him pass by," reveal the depth of her infatuation.

Marie's obsession with the Duke represents her romantic idealism and her aspirations to move in the highest circles of European aristocracy. Her fixation on him also reveals her emotional intensity and tendency toward melodramatic imagination.

The entries from late August and early September 1873 show how Marie's infatuation with the Duke became a topic of family discussion and teasing after her return to Nice. Her mother appears skeptical of the match, suggesting the Duke's income is much lower than Marie believes, while others like Princess Galitzine encourage Marie's fantasies by calling her "duchesse" (duchess). Marie expresses frustration that her private feelings have become public knowledge, writing "I am vexed, I did not want Hamilton to become public. For, what humiliation if nothing succeeds!"

## Physical Appearance and Character

From Marie's diary entries, we learn that she is attracted to the Duke's physical appearance, describing him as tall, large/stout, and red-haired or ruddy-complexioned. She repeatedly mentions her preference for "les grands, gros, blonds" (tall, stout, blond men) when discussing potential husbands with her family.

Marie's family and acquaintances describe the Duke as eccentric or original. Walitsky tells anecdotes about the Duke bringing a pig to a promenade when dogs were forbidden, and serving soup in chamber pots at a breakfast he hosted. While these stories may be exaggerated or fabricated to tease Marie, they suggest the Duke had a reputation for unconventional behavior.

## Financial Status

Marie's diary reveals conflicting information about the Duke's wealth. Her family discusses his income, with estimates ranging from 3,000 to 90,000 pounds sterling annually. Marie's aunt mentions that "he has become poor" and now has only 20,000 pounds instead of 90,000. Marie insists this is still substantial (equivalent to 500,000 francs), though her mother tries to diminish this amount in their conversations.

Marie frankly admits she would not marry the Duke if he were poor, writing: "Alas no! I will not marry him if he is poor, but I will always love him. I cannot marry a poor man, it is against my nature, it would be the misfortune of both."

## Historical Context

In 1873, the Duke of Hamilton was 28 years old and would marry Lady Mary Montagu later that same year (on July 10, 1873). He was known for his aristocratic lifestyle and passion for horse racing, though his financial difficulties were significant despite inheriting vast estates.

His horse Cortolvin had won the Grand National Steeplechase in 1867, but by 1873, his racing fortunes had apparently declined. Marie mentions in her diary that he is "reduced to a single horse instead of five" and "for three years he has fallen in the races, arriving only third."

The Duke had significant family connections to European royalty. His mother, Princess Marie Amelie of Baden, was the sister of the Grand Duke of Baden, who was married to the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm I of Prussia. This made the Duke of Hamilton a nephew by marriage to the Prussian royal family.

Marie mentions receiving "The Derby" newspaper and being pleased to see the Duke's name mentioned frequently in it, indicating his continued involvement in horse racing circles.

## Later Life

The Duke's marriage to Lady Mary Montagu produced one daughter, Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. His later years were marked by declining health and financial difficulties. He died in 1895 at the age of 50, with his titles passing to his cousin Alfred Douglas Douglas-Hamilton.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **August 18-19, 1873**: Marie expresses excitement at potentially seeing the Duke in Paris
- **August 19, 1873**: She reflects on whether she truly loves him or if it's merely her imagination
- **August 26-28, 1873**: Marie refers to him as "le misérable" (the miserable one) and contemplates how she would feel if he were dead or married
- **August 29-31, 1873**: Upon returning to Nice, Marie's family begins teasing her about her interest in the Duke
- **August 31, 1873**: Extended family discussion about the Duke's income and Marie's marriage prospects
- **September 1, 1873**: Continued teasing about the Duke, with Walitsky sharing anecdotes about his eccentric behavior

## Emile_Zola

# Émile Zola

## Basic Information

Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (1840-1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, and a major figure in the literary school of naturalism. He was also an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff was familiar with Zola's work and the naturalist movement. Her diary itself has been considered a "document humain" (human document), a term popularized by naturalist writers like Zola. The raw honesty and detailed observations in Marie's diary align with the naturalist approach to documenting human experience.

Zola's emphasis on detailed documentation of everyday life and his belief in literature as a scientific study of human behavior resonated with Marie's own approach to her diary writing. Though they never met personally, Marie was part of the artistic and literary circles in Paris where Zola's influence was significant.

## Historical Context

Zola was born in Paris in 1840 and became one of the most influential writers of the late 19th century. He is known for his 20-novel series *Les Rougon-Macquart*, which follows two branches of a family during the Second French Empire.

As a prominent figure in the naturalist movement, Zola believed in the objective study of human behavior through literature. His works often depicted the harsh realities of working-class life and tackled controversial social issues.

Zola was also known for his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, publishing the famous open letter "J'Accuse…!" in 1898, which accused the French government of antisemitism in the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus.

## Literary Influence

Zola's naturalist approach emphasized:
- Detailed observation and documentation of reality
- Scientific objectivity in portraying human behavior
- Focus on the influence of heredity and environment on character
- Unflinching portrayal of all aspects of life, including the sordid and unpleasant

These principles influenced many writers of Marie's era, including the way personal accounts and diaries were valued as authentic "human documents."

## Notable Works

- *Thérèse Raquin* (1867)
- *L'Assommoir* (1877) - about alcoholism and poverty in working-class Paris
- *Nana* (1880) - about a prostitute
- *Germinal* (1885) - about a coal miners' strike
- *J'Accuse…!* (1898) - open letter on the Dreyfus Affair

## Mentions in the Diary

While direct mentions of Zola in Marie's diary are limited, his influence on the literary and artistic culture of her time was significant. Marie's own artistic aspirations and her desire to document her life in detail show parallels with the naturalist movement that Zola championed.

## Ferry

# Ferry

## Overview

Ferry appears to be a bootmaker or shoe merchant in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned briefly in Marie Bashkirtseff's September 18, 1873 diary entry when she comments on the quality of boots she is wearing.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Ferry in her September 18, 1873 diary entry:

> "Avant *tout* ils chantent une messe funèbre et me rendent méchante (robe écrue de Dina, bien), bottines de Ferry, charmantes."
> 
> (Before *everything* they sing a funeral mass and make me angry (Dina's ecru dress, good), boots from Ferry, charming.)

This brief parenthetical comment suggests that Ferry was a source of footwear that Marie found particularly pleasing. The description of the boots as "charmantes" (charming) indicates her satisfaction with their quality or style.

## Historical Context

In the fashion-conscious society of 1870s Nice, quality footwear was an important element of a well-dressed appearance. For a young woman of Marie's social class, having well-made, fashionable boots would have been essential for social occasions, promenades, and everyday wear.

Bootmakers and shoemakers in fashionable resort towns like Nice would have catered to a wealthy clientele, including both local aristocracy and international visitors. They would have been expected to produce footwear that followed the latest Parisian fashions while providing comfort and durability.

Women's boots in the early 1870s typically featured:
- Button or lace closures
- Medium to high heels
- Pointed toes
- Fine leather construction
- Decorative elements such as contrasting stitching or materials

Marie's appreciation for her "bottines de Ferry" suggests that this particular bootmaker or merchant provided products that met her high standards for style and quality.

## Business and Location

Without further mentions in the diary, it's difficult to determine whether Ferry was:

1. A local bootmaker who custom-made footwear for clients
2. A merchant who sold ready-made boots, possibly imported from Paris or other fashion centers
3. A brand name of boots that Marie purchased from a local shop

The possessive construction "bottines de Ferry" could indicate either that the boots were made by someone named Ferry or that they were purchased from a shop called Ferry.

In the context of Nice in the 1870s, it's most likely that Ferry was either a local artisan bootmaker or a shop specializing in quality footwear, catering to the wealthy international clientele that frequented the French Riviera during this period.

## French_Theater_Nice

# French Theater in Nice

## Basic Information

The French Theater in Nice (Théâtre Français de Nice) was an important cultural venue in Nice during the 1870s. It hosted French-language theatrical productions, including both classical plays and contemporary comedies. The theater served as a social gathering place for the local elite and foreign visitors, particularly the Russian expatriate community that had established itself in Nice.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff attended the opening night of the 1873-1874 season at the French Theater on September 13, 1873. Her detailed description of this event provides valuable insights into both the theatrical culture of Nice and the social dynamics of the Russian community there.

For Marie, the theater represented an important social venue where she could display her fashion sense, observe others, and participate in the cultural life of Nice. Her diary entry about the theater visit reveals her concern with proper appearance (changing from her preferred gray dress to a white one at her mother's insistence) and her strong sense of social propriety (being scandalized by the presence of her father's mistress, Anna, in a nearby box).

The theater also served as a place of cultural education for Marie, as evidenced by her detailed summary of the play "Le changement de mains" about Empress Elisabeth of Russia, showing her interest in Russian history and theatrical narratives.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Nice had become a popular winter resort for wealthy Europeans, particularly Russians. The city had been part of the Kingdom of Sardinia until 1860, when it was annexed to France. This relatively recent change in national identity meant that Nice in the 1870s was a cosmopolitan city with Italian, French, and international influences.

The French Theater was part of Nice's cultural infrastructure that catered to this international elite. Theatrical performances were a central part of social life for the upper classes in the 19th century, providing entertainment, cultural enrichment, and opportunities for social display and interaction.

The 1873-1874 theater season opened with two productions: "Le changement de mains" (The Change of Hands), a historical drama set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of Empress Elisabeth, and "Les jocrisses de l'amour" (The Fools of Love), a comedy that Marie found too risqué and left after the second act.

## Social Significance

The theater served multiple social functions beyond entertainment:

1. **Social Display**: The theater was a place to see and be seen, with attention paid to dress, appearance, and social connections.

2. **Class Boundaries**: The box system at the theater physically manifested social hierarchies, with better boxes indicating higher status.

3. **Moral Boundaries**: Marie's reaction to the "crude" comedy and her decision to leave shows how the theater could also be a site for negotiating moral propriety.

4. **Community Formation**: For the Russian expatriate community in Nice, the theater provided a gathering place and cultural connection.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **September 13, 1873**: Marie attends the opening night of the French Theater season, watching "Le changement de mains" and part of "Les jocrisses de l'amour"
- **September 14, 1873**: Marie expresses indignation about Lefèvre's behavior at the theater the previous night

## Gioia

# Gioia (Amélia)

## Basic Information

Gioia (sometimes referred to as "Madame Amélia" in Marie's diary) was a beautiful woman who was the mistress of William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton. She appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as an object of both admiration and jealousy, representing Marie's complex feelings about beauty, social status, and romantic rivalry.

Marie first mentions Gioia in her diary entries from January 1873, when she observes the Duke visiting Gioia in Nice. Throughout her diary, Marie refers to Gioia using various nicknames, including "Laïs" (after a famous Greek courtesan) and "Centifolia" (a type of rose), indicating both her fascination with and objectification of this woman.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Gioia represents both an ideal of feminine beauty for Marie and a painful reminder of her unrequited love for the Duke of Hamilton. Marie's diary entries reveal her complex and contradictory feelings toward Gioia:

- **Admiration**: Marie frequently describes Gioia as "sublime," "perfect," and "beautiful like an angel," considering her the "perfection, the ideal, the divinity of woman"
- **Jealousy**: She expresses envy of Gioia's relationship with the Duke and her physical attributes
- **Identification**: Marie is flattered when others suggest she resembles Gioia, and she sometimes imitates Gioia's hairstyle
- **Obsession**: She goes out of her way to see Gioia during promenades, sometimes following her or changing routes to encounter her

Marie's encounter with Gioia's portrait at the Walery photography studio on August 26, 1873, had a particularly profound emotional impact. Her repeated viewing of Gioia's photographs and her comparison of herself to this beautiful woman demonstrates her complex emotions about beauty and romantic rivalry.

## Physical Appearance and Lifestyle

From Marie's descriptions, we learn that Gioia was:

- Tall with a "majestic" bearing and elegant manners
- Known for her beauty, though Marie notes she wore heavy makeup ("fardée comme un meunier" - "made up like a miller")
- Fashionable, with Marie describing her various outfits in detail
- Living in a luxurious villa on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice
- Wealthy enough to maintain a carriage, servants, and expensive clothing
- The mother of a son, who Marie mentions was not the Duke's child

Marie's diary provides glimpses of Gioia's lifestyle, including her home (which had a "salon gris et cerise" - gray and cherry-colored salon), her social activities, and her relationships. After the Duke of Hamilton's marriage to Lady Mary Montagu in July 1873, Gioia appears to have left Nice temporarily, with Marie noting that her house was being renovated or redecorated in late 1873, suggesting her return.

## Later Developments

Marie's diary entries from late 1873 and early 1874 suggest that Gioia's circumstances changed after the Duke's marriage. She mentions Gioia appearing in a rented landau rather than her own carriage, which Marie interprets as a sign of reduced circumstances. She also records gossip about Gioia's financial difficulties and her relationships with other men, including Count Lambertye and someone named Krassowsky.

By December 1873, Marie notes that Gioia had returned to Nice and appeared at the theater "in velvet black, old laces and diamonds." She also mentions a New Year's Eve scandal involving Gioia, Krassowsky, and another woman named Soubise at the Cercle de la Méditerranée (a social club in Nice).

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Gioia extensively throughout her diary from January 1873 to early 1874. Key entries include:

- **January 19, 1873**: First mention of Gioia, when Marie sees the Duke visiting her
- **January 30, 1873**: Marie sees Gioia in a closed carriage with a man who is not the Duke
- **February 7, 1873**: Marie expresses her belief that the Duke is "too occupied with Gioia" to notice her
- **February 9, 1873**: Marie admits that Gioia is "beautiful, more beautiful than me"
- **August 25, 1873**: Marie sees Gioia's portrait and has an intense emotional reaction
- **August 26, 1873**: Marie visits the Walery studio and repeatedly views photographs of Gioia
- **December 1873**: Marie notes Gioia's return to Nice and her appearance at the theater
- **January 1, 1874**: References to a scandal involving Gioia at the Cercle de la Méditerranée

## Hitchcock

# Hitchcock

## Overview

Hitchcock (first name unknown) was Marie Bashkirtseff's English conversation teacher in Nice during 1873. She is mentioned in Marie's September 15, 1873 diary entry as providing conversation lessons that Marie considered "more useful than all other things."

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Hitchcock in her September 15, 1873 diary entry:

> "Mais j'eus une leçon de conver­sation avec la Hitchcock, c'est plus utile que toutes [les] autres choses."
> 
> (But I had a conversation lesson with Hitchcock, it's more useful than all other things.)

The use of the feminine article "la" before Hitchcock indicates that the teacher was a woman. Marie's comment about the usefulness of these conversation lessons suggests she valued practical language skills over more formal or theoretical language instruction.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, English was becoming increasingly important as an international language, particularly in diplomatic and aristocratic circles. For a young woman of Marie's social class and ambitions, fluency in English would have been a valuable skill.

Language instruction in this period often emphasized grammar, translation, and reading comprehension over conversational ability. Marie's appreciation for conversation lessons with Hitchcock suggests she recognized the practical importance of being able to speak English fluently, not just read or write it.

Foreign language teachers for wealthy families in Nice during this period often came from the community of English and American expatriates who had settled in the French Riviera for health or leisure reasons. Hitchcock may have been a native English speaker who had settled in Nice and supplemented her income by teaching English to wealthy young women like Marie.

## Educational Approach

The fact that Marie specifically mentions "conversation lessons" suggests that Hitchcock's teaching approach was focused on practical speaking skills rather than formal grammar instruction. This would have involved dialogue practice, pronunciation correction, and possibly discussion of current events or literature to build vocabulary and fluency.

Marie's educational program was unusually comprehensive for a young woman of her time, including multiple languages (Russian, French, English, Italian, German, and Latin), as well as music, art, and sciences. Her English lessons with Hitchcock were part of this ambitious educational agenda.

## House_of_Worth

# House of Worth

## Basic Information

The House of Worth was a French haute couture fashion house founded by English designer Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895) in Paris in 1858. Located at 7 Rue de la Paix, it was the premier fashion house in Paris during the Second Empire and Belle Époque periods, essentially creating the concept of haute couture as we understand it today.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff's diary entries from August 1873 reveal her fascination with the House of Worth and her desire to own garments from this prestigious establishment. During her visit to Paris, she mentions visiting Worth multiple times, including a morning visit on August 27 to order a dress before her departure.

Marie's detailed descriptions of Worth dresses and their prices (700-1900 francs) demonstrate both the substantial cost of haute couture and her own social aspirations. Her preference for her Worth dress over creations from other fashion houses like Laferrière reflects Worth's superior status in the fashion hierarchy of the time.

For Marie, wearing Worth creations was not merely about fashion but about establishing her position in high society. Her willingness to spend significant sums on Worth garments, despite financial constraints, reveals the importance she placed on appearance and material display in the social world she inhabited and aspired to conquer.

## Historical Context

By 1873, when Marie visited the establishment, the House of Worth was at the height of its influence and prestige. Charles Frederick Worth had revolutionized the fashion industry by transforming the traditional dressmaker into a fashion designer in the modern sense.

Worth pioneered many practices that became standard in the fashion industry:
- Using live models to present seasonal collections to clients
- Creating a brand identity and attaching his label to garments
- Presenting clients with designs to choose from rather than following their specifications
- Creating seasonal collections with new designs

The House of Worth dressed European royalty, including Empress Eugénie of France, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and Queen Victoria, as well as wealthy Americans and prominent figures from around the world. Worth's designs were characterized by rich fabrics such as silk, velvet, and satin, often incorporating multiple fabrics in a single garment with elaborate trimmings including lace, beading, and embroidery.

In 1873, Worth's designs featured elaborate bustle silhouettes that had replaced the earlier crinoline styles of the 1860s. The silhouette was characterized by a tight-fitting bodice and a skirt that projected at the back, supported by a bustle.

## Later History

After Charles Frederick Worth's death in 1895, his sons Gaston-Lucien (1853-1924) and Jean-Philippe (1856-1926) continued the business. The House of Worth remained influential into the early 20th century but gradually declined in prominence with changing fashion trends after World War I. The house finally closed in 1952, though the Worth name was revived in 1999 for a perfume line.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **August 1873**: Marie visits Worth multiple times during her stay in Paris
- **August 27, 1873**: She makes a morning visit to Worth to order a dress before her departure
- Marie mentions prices of 700 francs for a dress from Worth and 1,900 francs for her aunt's dress

## Le_Bon_Marche

# Le Bon Marché

## Basic Information

Le Bon Marché was the first modern department store in Paris and a pioneering institution in retail history. Founded in 1838 as a small haberdashery by Aristide Boucicaut and his wife Marguerite, it underwent significant expansion in the early 1870s to become a revolutionary shopping destination. By 1873, when Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris, Le Bon Marché had recently been expanded with the help of Gustave Eiffel's engineering firm and featured 22 departments across multiple floors with wide, open interiors.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie mentions Le Bon Marché in her diary during her Paris visit in August 1873. Her cousin Dina suggested visiting the store, but Marie dismissed the idea, considering it beneath her social standing. Marie's diary entry notes that she considered shopping at Le Bon Marché as reflecting "vulgaire" tastes, which reveals her aristocratic aspirations and social snobbery.

This attitude toward department stores versus exclusive boutiques and fashion houses like Worth and Laferrière demonstrates Marie's preoccupation with social status and her desire to associate herself with the highest echelons of society. Despite the store's growing popularity and innovative retail concepts, Marie preferred the exclusive experience of haute couture establishments and specialized boutiques.

## Historical Context

Le Bon Marché revolutionized retail in the 19th century by introducing several innovations that define modern department stores:

- Fixed pricing (replacing the traditional haggling system)
- The ability to browse freely without obligation to buy
- A wide variety of goods under one roof
- Seasonal sales and special promotions
- Money-back guarantees
- Home delivery services

The store catered particularly to women of the growing middle class, offering them a respectable public space to shop independently. By the 1870s, Le Bon Marché had become not just a shopping destination but a social institution and tourist attraction.

The 1870s expansion, completed in 1872, transformed the store into an architectural marvel with iron and glass construction, grand staircases, and a light-filled central hall. The Boucicauts also introduced innovative employee benefits including profit-sharing, pension plans, free medical care, and educational opportunities for staff.

Marie's dismissal of Le Bon Marché reflects a common attitude among the aristocracy and those with aristocratic aspirations, who often viewed department stores as catering to the bourgeoisie despite the fact that these establishments were transforming consumer culture across all social classes.

## Later History

Le Bon Marché continued to thrive and expand in the decades following Marie's visit. In 1887, it moved to its current location on the Left Bank of Paris, in a building designed by Louis-Charles Boileau and Gustave Eiffel. The store survived both World Wars and remains in operation today as an upscale department store owned by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **August 1873**: Marie dismisses her cousin Dina's suggestion to visit Le Bon Marché, considering it beneath her social standing

## Le_ravin

# Le ravin (The Precipice)

## Basic Information

"Le ravin" (The Precipice) is a Russian novel that Marie Bashkirtseff mentions reading in her September 1873 diary entries. Based on her descriptions of the characters and plot elements, this appears to be "Обрыв" (The Precipice) by Ivan Goncharov, published in 1869. In her diary, Marie refers to it by its French translation title "Le ravin."

## The Novel and Its Author

Ivan Goncharov (1812-1891) was a major Russian novelist of the 19th century, best known for his novel "Oblomov" (1859). "The Precipice," his third and final novel, was published in 1869 after being serialized in the journal "Vestnik Evropy" (The European Herald). The novel explores themes of generational conflict, the changing social landscape of Russia, and the clash between traditional values and new, radical ideas.

The novel centers around a love triangle involving the young, idealistic artist Raisky, his cousin Vera, and the nihilist Mark Volokhov. Set in a provincial Russian town on the Volga River, the story unfolds against the backdrop of a literal precipice that becomes a metaphor for the moral and social dangers facing Russian society.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie's engagement with "Le ravin" reveals several aspects of her intellectual and cultural life:

1. **Literary Interests**: Despite claiming to have "mépris pour les romans" (contempt for novels), Marie shows genuine enthusiasm for this Russian novel, particularly enjoying its humor and character development.

2. **Russian Cultural Identity**: Her reading of contemporary Russian literature in French translation demonstrates her connection to Russian culture despite living abroad.

3. **Intellectual Capacity**: Her detailed analysis of the characters and plot shows her sophisticated literary understanding at the young age of 14.

4. **Reading Habits**: Marie mentions that she "n'ai jamais la patience de finir un roman" (never has the patience to finish a novel), yet she continues reading this one in installments, suggesting that it particularly captured her interest.

## Marie's Commentary on the Novel

In her September 6, 1873 entry, Marie provides a detailed and enthusiastic assessment of the novel and its characters:

- She finds the dream sequence of the character Vikentieff "extrarisible" (extremely funny)
- She describes the grandmother character as "sublime"
- She characterizes Marfinka as "charmante" (charming)
- She calls Vera "folle" (crazy/wild)
- She describes Mark as "original insolent" (originally insolent)
- She particularly enjoys Vikentieff, finding him "plein d'humour et de verve" (full of humor and verve)

Her cousin Dina was so taken with Vikentieff's dream sequence that she wanted to retell it as her own, changing the character names to those of people they knew.

## Historical and Cultural Context

Marie's reading of "The Precipice" in 1873, just four years after its publication, shows that she kept up with contemporary Russian literature despite living in France. The novel would have been particularly relevant to Russians living abroad, as it deals with questions of Russian identity and the tension between traditional Russian values and Western European influences.

The fact that Marie was reading the novel in French translation ("Le ravin") rather than in the original Russian may reflect her educational background. While she was fluent in multiple languages, her formal education had been primarily in French, which may have made reading complex literary works easier in that language.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **September 2, 1873**: Marie mentions reading "Le ravin" but notes she "never has the patience to finish a novel"
- **September 6, 1873**: Detailed discussion of the novel's characters, particularly enjoying Vikentieff's dream sequence
- **September 7, 1873**: Mentions reading "Le ravin" again

[//]: # ( 2025-04-05T18:50:00 RSR: Created glossary entry for "Le ravin" (The Precipice) based on Marie's September 1873 diary entries. The novel appears to be Ivan Goncharov's "Обрыв" (The Precipice) published in 1869, which Marie was reading in French translation. )

## Michelezzi

# Michelezzi

## Overview

Michelezzi (first name unknown) was Marie Bashkirtseff's Italian teacher in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned in Marie's September 15, 1873 diary entry when she proudly describes speaking Italian for the first time, causing her teacher to nearly "faint or throw himself out the window" with surprise or delight.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Michelezzi in her September 15, 1873 diary entry:

> "J'ai pour la première fois parlé l'italien aujourd'hui. Le pauvre Michelezzi faillit tomber évanoui ou se jeter par la fenêtre. Je suis contente moi-même, je puis dire que je *parle* le russe, le français, l'anglais et l'italien. J'apprends l'alle­mand et le latin."
> 
> (I spoke Italian for the first time today. Poor Michelezzi nearly fainted or threw himself out the window. I am pleased with myself, I can say that I *speak* Russian, French, English, and Italian. I am learning German and Latin.)

Marie's description of Michelezzi's dramatic reaction suggests either that her progress was unexpectedly good or that he was an expressive, emotional teacher. The fact that she emphasizes this as the "first time" she spoke Italian indicates that previous lessons may have focused on reading, writing, or grammar rather than conversation.

## Historical Context

Italian was an important language for educated Europeans in the 19th century, particularly for those interested in art, music, and culture. Nice's proximity to Italy (having only been annexed by France from the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860) meant that Italian culture and language remained influential in the region.

For a young woman of Marie's social class and artistic aspirations, knowledge of Italian would have been valuable for appreciating opera, reading classical literature, and participating in cosmopolitan society. The Italian language was also practical for travel in Italy, which was a common destination for wealthy Europeans.

## Educational Approach

Based on Marie's description of suddenly speaking Italian for the first time, it appears that Michelezzi's teaching approach may have initially emphasized passive knowledge (reading, grammar) before active production (speaking). This was a common language teaching methodology in the 19th century.

Marie's pride in her linguistic accomplishments is evident in this entry, as she lists the four languages she can now speak (Russian, French, English, and Italian) and mentions two more she is studying (German and Latin). This ambitious language program reflects both her intellectual capabilities and the expectations for educated young women in aristocratic European society.

## Monte_Carlo

# Monte-Carlo

## Basic Information

Monte-Carlo is a district of the Principality of Monaco, a small sovereign state on the French Riviera. It became internationally famous in the late 19th century for its casino and gambling facilities. The Monte-Carlo Casino, officially opened in 1863, was developed by the Société des Bains de Mer (SBM), founded by François Blanc, with the support of Prince Charles III of Monaco as a way to save the House of Grimaldi from bankruptcy.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Monte-Carlo appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a leisure destination for her family and the Russian expatriate community in Nice. Located just a short distance from Nice, it was easily accessible by train or carriage, making it a popular day-trip destination.

Marie's diary entries reveal that visits to Monte-Carlo were a regular part of her social life. She mentions gambling at the casino, dining at the restaurants, and encountering acquaintances there. These visits provided entertainment and social opportunities for Marie and her family, who were part of the wealthy international community that frequented the French Riviera.

Her September 7, 1873 entry provides a particularly detailed account of a visit to Monte-Carlo, including her participation in gambling (unusual for a 14-year-old girl), her frustration at missing the train back to Nice, and her chance sighting of Gioia (the Duke of Hamilton's mistress) at the casino.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Monte-Carlo was establishing itself as one of Europe's premier gambling and leisure destinations. The success of the casino had transformed Monaco from a poor principality into a wealthy playground for the aristocracy and the nouveau riche. The Belle Époque architecture, luxurious facilities, and the mild Mediterranean climate made it particularly attractive to wealthy Russians, who had begun to establish a significant presence on the French Riviera.

The Monte-Carlo Casino was not just a gambling establishment but a complex that included a theater (the Salle Garnier, opened in 1879), restaurants, and other entertainment facilities. It attracted visitors from across Europe, particularly during the winter season when the wealthy fled the cold northern climates for the Mediterranean.

Monaco did not charge income tax to its residents, making it an attractive place for the wealthy. This tax advantage, combined with the gambling facilities and luxurious amenities, helped establish Monte-Carlo's reputation as a playground for the rich.

## Social Significance

Monte-Carlo served several important social functions for the expatriate community on the French Riviera:

1. **Social Networking**: The casino and its surrounding facilities provided a venue for the international elite to see and be seen, make connections, and display their wealth and status.

2. **Entertainment**: Beyond gambling, Monte-Carlo offered concerts, theatrical performances, and fine dining.

3. **Gambling Culture**: The casino represented a particular form of aristocratic leisure that combined risk-taking, wealth display, and social interaction.

4. **Gender Dynamics**: Marie's participation in gambling, despite her young age, reflects the somewhat more permissive attitudes toward women's behavior in these international resort settings compared to more traditional environments.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **September 1, 1873**: Marie mentions her aunt, the princess, and Walitsky going to Monaco
- **September 3, 1873**: Reference to her aunt, the princess, and Walitsky being at Monaco
- **September 7, 1873**: Detailed account of a visit to Monte-Carlo, including gambling, missing the train, and seeing Gioia
- **September 11, 1873**: Mention of her mother being at Monaco and returning in M. Chaussade's coupé

## Mouton

# Mouton

## Overview

Mouton appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as someone associated with horses in Nice during 1873. Based on the context of Marie's mentions, he was likely a stable owner, horse dealer, or riding instructor from whom Marie rented or borrowed horses for her rides.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Mouton in her September 15, 1873 diary entry when describing problems with her horse:

> "Il faut que je me trouve bien mal pour descendre du cheval, car je pouvais à peine arriver chez Mouton, je lui rendis le cheval avec un scolding et je remontais en voiture."
> 
> (I must have been feeling quite unwell to get off the horse, because I could barely reach Mouton's place, I returned the horse to him with a scolding and got back into the carriage.)

This suggests that Mouton was someone to whom Marie would return a horse after riding, indicating he owned or managed horses that Marie used.

In her September 19, 1873 entry, Marie again mentions Mouton when having trouble with her saddle:

> "Mais la selle devient inquiétante et je vais chez Mouton qui l'arrange encore une fois, et encore une fois elle recule. Enfin, aux Ponchettes, je me vois définitivement contrainte de quitter mon Pégase, je monte en landau et Paul furieux prend les rênes du cheval. Tout le temps jusqu'à Mouton il rageait et je riais de sa rage..."
> 
> (But the saddle becomes worrying and I go to Mouton's who arranges it once more, and once more it slips back. Finally, at the Ponchettes, I find myself definitively forced to leave my Pegasus, I get into the landau and Paul, furious, takes the reins of the horse. The whole time until [we reached] Mouton's he was raging and I was laughing at his rage...)

This passage confirms that Mouton had a physical location ("chez Mouton") where horses could be taken, and that he provided services such as adjusting saddles. The fact that Paul took the horse "jusqu'à Mouton" (until [we reached] Mouton's) after Marie had to abandon her ride further suggests that Mouton was the person from whom the horse was obtained and to whom it would be returned.

## Role and Business

Based on these mentions, Mouton appears to have been:

1. A stable owner, horse dealer, or riding master in Nice
2. Someone who provided horses for Marie's rides
3. Someone who could adjust or repair riding equipment like saddles
4. Someone with a physical establishment ("chez Mouton") where horses could be taken

In 19th century Nice, horseback riding was an important social activity for the aristocracy and wealthy visitors. Establishments that provided horses for hire, riding lessons, and related services were essential to support this activity. Mouton's business would have catered to this wealthy clientele, including visitors like Marie and her family.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, before the widespread adoption of automobiles, horses were the primary means of transportation and recreation for the upper classes. In resort towns like Nice, which attracted wealthy visitors from across Europe, businesses that provided horses and related services were important parts of the local economy.

For a young woman of Marie's social class, horseback riding was both a leisure activity and a social accomplishment. The ability to ride well was considered an important skill for young women of the aristocracy, and riding on the promenade was a way to see and be seen in society.

Marie's frustration with the poorly fitting saddle that "recule" (slips back) during her rides suggests that the equipment provided by Mouton may not have been of the highest quality, or perhaps was not properly adjusted for a female rider.

## Paris_1870s

# Paris in the 1870s

## Basic Information

Paris in the 1870s was a city in transition, recovering from the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune uprising (1871) while reestablishing itself as the cultural and fashion capital of Europe. The early 1870s marked the beginning of the Third Republic in France, a period of political reorganization following the fall of Napoleon III's Second Empire.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris in August 1873 and developed a deep admiration for the city. Her diary entries reveal her enthusiasm for Paris as the cultural and fashion capital of the world. She writes passionately about the city's atmosphere, the quality of the people she sees, and her desire to eventually move there from Nice.

Marie's statement that "Tous les endroits sont égaux pour moi excepté Paris que j'adore et Nice que j'abhorre" (All places are equal to me except Paris, which I adore, and Nice, which I abhor) reveals her strong preference for the cultural and social opportunities of Paris over the provincial atmosphere of Nice.

For Marie, Paris represented opportunity, sophistication, and the possibility of achieving her artistic and social ambitions. Her shopping experiences at prestigious establishments like the House of Worth, her visits to cultural venues, and her observations of Parisian society all reinforced her desire to establish herself in this cosmopolitan environment.

## Historical Context

Paris in 1873 was in a period of recovery and transformation. The city had suffered significant damage during the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent Paris Commune uprising. The siege of Paris (September 1870 to January 1871) had caused severe hardship, and the violent suppression of the Commune in May 1871 had resulted in thousands of deaths and the destruction of numerous buildings.

By 1873, reconstruction efforts were underway, guided by urban planner Baron Haussmann's earlier vision of a modern city with wide boulevards, grand public spaces, and improved infrastructure. The Third Republic, established in 1870, was still consolidating its political structures, with monarchist factions maintaining significant influence in the early 1870s.

Despite these challenges, Paris was regaining its position as a center of culture, fashion, and society. The city's theaters, opera houses, and other cultural venues were active, and its fashion houses, including the House of Worth, continued to set international trends. The Parisian elite maintained their social rituals, including promenades in the Bois de Boulogne and attendance at the opera and theater.

## Key Locations in 1870s Paris

### Fashion and Shopping

- **Rue de la Paix**: Home to prestigious fashion houses including Worth (No. 7) and milliner Caroline Reboux (No. 23)
- **Rue Taitbout**: Location of Maison Laferrière (No. 28), another high-end fashion house
- **Le Bon Marché**: A department store that underwent significant expansion in the early 1870s
- **Aux Trois Quartiers**: A department store established on Boulevard de la Madeleine

### Entertainment and Culture

- **Opéra-Comique**: A famous opera house located at its second Salle Favart building on Place Boieldieu
- **Théâtre des Folies Dramatiques**: A theater where Marie saw "La fille de Madame Angot," a popular comic opera
- **Bois de Boulogne**: A large public park on the western edge of Paris, recovering from damage during the Franco-Prussian War
- **Longchamp Racecourse**: Established in 1857 in the Bois de Boulogne, the premier venue for horse racing in Paris

## Mentions in the Diary

- **August 16-19, 1873**: Marie travels from Vienna to Paris and expresses her admiration for the city
- **August 19-27, 1873**: She documents her shopping experiences, cultural activities, and observations of Parisian society
- Throughout her diary, Marie contrasts Paris favorably with Nice and expresses her desire to eventually establish herself in Paris

## Said

# Saïd

## Overview

Saïd appears to be a servant or staff member in the Bashkirtseff household in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned briefly in Marie's September 17, 1873 diary entry when she discusses ordering a livery (uniform) for him.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Saïd in her September 17, 1873 diary entry:

> "A quatre heures, je veux sor­tir pour commander une livrée à Saïd, des bottes pour moi et je ne me souviens plus quoi encore."
> 
> (At four o'clock, I want to go out to order a livery for Saïd, boots for myself, and I don't remember what else.)

This brief mention suggests that Saïd was a servant or staff member for whom Marie was ordering a uniform. The fact that Marie was responsible for ordering his livery indicates her role in managing certain household affairs, despite her young age.

## Historical Context

The name "Saïd" is Arabic in origin, suggesting he may have been from North Africa, possibly Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco, which were French colonies or protectorates during this period. It was not uncommon for wealthy European families in the late 19th century to employ servants from the colonies.

Liveries were uniforms worn by household servants, particularly those who had public-facing roles such as footmen, coachmen, or valets. The fact that Marie was ordering a livery for Saïd suggests he may have had one of these roles, possibly as a footman or personal attendant who would accompany family members in public.

In the social hierarchy of a wealthy household in the 1870s, the appearance of servants was considered a reflection of the family's status. Well-dressed servants in proper liveries were a sign of wealth and social standing. Marie's attention to ordering a livery for Saïd reflects this concern with maintaining appropriate appearances.

## Possible Roles

Based on the limited information available, Saïd might have been:

1. A footman who would accompany family members on outings, open doors, carry packages, etc.
2. A personal attendant to Marie or another family member
3. A coachman or assistant to the coachman (though this seems less likely as Marie mentions other coachmen by name elsewhere)
4. A household servant with duties that required him to be seen by visitors, thus necessitating a livery

Without further mentions in the diary, it's difficult to determine Saïd's exact role in the household. However, the fact that Marie was ordering a livery for him indicates he had some visibility or public-facing role that required formal attire.

## Soubise

# Soubise

## Overview

Soubise was a woman in Nice who appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a companion or friend of Gioia, the Duke of Hamilton's mistress. Marie mentions her in September 1873 entries, comparing her to someone named "Pitou" and noting her presence with Gioia during encounters in Nice.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Soubise in her September 15, 1873 diary entry when describing an encounter with Gioia while horseback riding:

> "A la promenade je vois une femme jolie et gracieuse, c'est Gioia, je l'ai reconnue après l'avoir passée. Je retourne of course, elle marche avec la Soubise, fi !"
> 
> (At the promenade I see a pretty and graceful woman, it's Gioia, I recognized her after passing her. I turn around of course, she is walking with Soubise, fie!)

The expression "fi!" suggests Marie's disdain for this association.

In her September 19, 1873 entry, Marie again mentions Soubise when describing another encounter with Gioia:

> "Tout à coup, je vois arriver Gioia avec Pitou (Soubise ressemble au feu Pitou comme une sœur)."
> 
> (Suddenly, I see Gioia arriving with Pitou (Soubise resembles the late Pitou like a sister).)

Later in the same entry, Marie comments on Gioia and Soubise's mode of transportation:

> "Et quelle misère avec La Soubise en fiacre. Est-ce pareil aux années d'avant, non, non."
> 
> (And what misery with Soubise in a hired cab. Is it the same as in previous years, no, no.)

This comment suggests that Marie sees their use of a hired cab (fiacre) as a sign of reduced circumstances compared to previous years.

## Character and Social Position

Based on Marie's limited mentions, we can infer that:

1. Soubise was a woman in Nice society who associated with Gioia, the Duke of Hamilton's mistress
2. She physically resembled someone known as "Pitou" (possibly deceased, given the phrase "feu Pitou")
3. Marie seems to look down on her, as suggested by the dismissive "fi!" after mentioning her
4. Her traveling in a hired cab with Gioia is noted by Marie as a sign of reduced social status compared to previous years

The fact that Marie refers to her as "la Soubise" (with the definite article) might suggest she was known by a title or surname rather than a first name, which was common in referring to certain social classes in 19th century France.

## Historical Context

In the social hierarchy of Nice in the 1870s, women associated with aristocratic men as mistresses or companions often formed their own social circles. Soubise may have been part of this demi-monde - women who were not accepted in respectable society but who moved in wealthy circles due to their relationships with aristocratic or wealthy men.

Marie's comment about Soubise and Gioia using a hired cab suggesting reduced circumstances reflects the importance of maintaining appearances in this social milieu. The type of transportation one used was a significant marker of social status and financial means.

## Vienna_World_Exhibition

# Vienna World Exhibition of 1873

## Basic Information

The Vienna World Exhibition (Weltausstellung 1873 Wien) was held from May 1 to November 2, 1873, in the Austro-Hungarian capital. It was the fifth world exposition and the first to be held in a German-speaking country. The exhibition was designed to showcase industrial, cultural, and scientific achievements from around the world and coincided with Emperor Franz Joseph I's 25th anniversary as ruler.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie visited the Vienna World Exhibition during her stay in Vienna in August 1873. In her diary entries from August 11-15, 1873, she mentions visiting the "Exposition" several times. On August 13, she specifically notes visiting the "Agrikulturhalle" (Agricultural Hall) where she found her father's tobacco on display. She also mentions seeing Lefèvre's wine.

Her visits to the exhibition represent her family's participation in elite cultural events and their connections to European high society. The fact that her father's tobacco was displayed at the exhibition also indicates the family's economic interests and status.

## Historical Context

The Vienna World Exhibition faced significant challenges, including the stock market crash of May 1873 (part of the global "Panic of 1873") and a concurrent cholera epidemic, which severely impacted attendance. This may explain Marie's mention of her aunt's fear of cholera when Marie became ill on August 14.

The centerpiece of the fair was the Rotunda, the world's largest domed building at the time, surrounded by themed halls including the Palace of Industry and the Hall of Engines. National exhibits showcased both technological innovation and traditional arts, emphasizing cultural pride.

The exhibition aimed to elevate Austria-Hungary's status among major European powers like France and Britain. Despite financial difficulties and lower-than-expected attendance (about 7 million visitors compared to the projected 20 million), the exhibition succeeded in showcasing Vienna as a cultural and technological center.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **August 11-15, 1873**: Marie makes multiple visits to the exhibition
- **August 13, 1873**: She specifically mentions visiting the Agricultural Hall and seeing her father's tobacco and Lefèvre's wine on display
- **August 14, 1873**: Marie falls ill, and her aunt fears it might be cholera, which was affecting Vienna during the exhibition

## Walery_Studio

# Walery Studio

## Basic Information

The Walery photography studio was a prestigious portrait photography establishment in Paris during the late 19th century. It was founded by Count Stanisław Julian Ostroróg (1830-1890), a Polish nobleman who fled to France after participating in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He established the studio under the name "Walery" (derived from his wife's name, Waleria).

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff visited the Walery studio on August 26, 1873, during her stay in Paris. Her diary entry about this visit provides valuable insights into both the world of high-end portrait photography in 1870s Paris and Marie's own emotional state.

At the studio, Marie was particularly fixated on viewing portraits of Gioia, a beautiful woman connected to the Duke of Hamilton (the object of Marie's infatuation). Marie's repeated viewing of Gioia's photographs and comparison of herself to this beautiful woman reveals her insecurities about her own appearance and attractiveness.

Marie's desire to have her portrait taken at Walery reflects both the studio's growing reputation as a fashionable establishment and her own social aspirations. Her visit to this prestigious studio aligns with her broader efforts to establish herself in Parisian high society through association with elite establishments.

## Historical Context

The Walery studio at 9 Rue de Londres in Paris had been established around 1871-1872, making it relatively new but already fashionable when Marie visited in 1873. The studio quickly gained fame for its portraits of celebrities, aristocrats, and beautiful women of the era.

Walery specialized in theatrical photography and portraits of opera singers, actresses, and other performers, which explains why Marie saw portraits of Gioia there. By 1873, the studio was becoming one of the most fashionable photography establishments in Paris, attracting clients from high society.

Walery's portraits were characterized by their dramatic lighting, elegant poses, and attention to detail. The photographs were often distributed as cabinet cards and cartes de visite, which were popular collectibles among the upper classes.

## Later History

The Walery studio later opened branches in London and Nice, further cementing its reputation as a premier photography establishment. After Stanisław Julian Ostroróg's death in 1890, his son, Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg (1863-1929), continued using the Walery name and became known for photographing theater and cabaret stars, including the famous dancer Mata Hari.

The younger Walery's photographs of the Folies Bergère and other Parisian entertainment venues created iconic images of the Belle Époque era. The Walery studio's photographs now serve as important historical documents of late 19th and early 20th century theatrical and social life.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **August 26, 1873**: Marie visits the Walery studio in Paris and views photographs of Gioia
- **September 4, 1873**: Marie receives her portrait photographs from Walery and critiques them, finding the poses "affected" and commenting that her hair arrangement gives "de la vulgarité" (vulgarity)
