## 1873-02 {#1873-02}

February 1873 marks the beginning of Marie Bashkirtseff's second notebook (Carnet N° 2). During this month, Marie is living in Nice with her family, participating in the winter social season that attracted wealthy European and Russian aristocrats to the French Riviera. The month coincides with the carnival season, culminating in Mardi Gras on February 25.

Marie's diary is dominated by her romantic interests, primarily:

1. **The Duke of Hamilton** - Marie's primary obsession, whom she rarely sees but intensely admires from afar. She considers him the perfect match due to his title, wealth, and aristocratic status. She is jealous of his relationship with a woman named Gioia.

2. **Alfred Boreel** - A handsome young man Marie sees frequently on the promenade. Her feelings for him fluctuate throughout the month, sometimes claiming to love him, other times dismissing him as merely a distraction. She is disappointed to learn he is not a baron as she initially believed.

Marie's days revolve around:

- Daily promenades (on foot, in carriages, or occasionally on horseback)

- Music performances in public gardens

- Theater and opera attendance

- Carnival festivities

- Balls and soirées

- Exchange of flowers and confetti

- Electric illuminations of the streets

Marie is highly conscious of her appearance and how others perceive her:

- She frequently describes her outfits in detail

- Notes when she blushes in the presence of her romantic interests

- Concerns herself with proper introductions and social protocols

- **The Italian Theater/Opera** - Another venue for performances

- **Monaco** - Nearby principality with casino, viewed as a place of vice and corruption

- **Cercle Masséna** - Social club hosting balls and matinées

Marie's diary reveals a young woman with:

- Dramatic emotional swings

- Religious framework for understanding her desires (frequent prayers to God)

- Concern with propriety alongside romantic obsessions

- Tendency toward self-criticism (evident in her later marginal notes)

February 1873 captures the winter social season in Nice, when wealthy Europeans and Russians would escape the northern winter for the mild Mediterranean climate. The carnival season was a major social event, with elaborate festivities leading up to Mardi Gras. Marie's diary provides a window into the social life, values, and preoccupations of a young aristocratic woman in this setting.

## 1873-03 {#1873-03}

The March 1873 entries (1st-12th) conclude Marie Bashkirtseff's second notebook (Carnet N° 2). This period marks a significant transition in Marie's life as she learns that the Duke of Hamilton has departed Nice, forcing her to reconsider her romantic aspirations. The month also features a pivotal moment when Marie discovers her singing talent might provide a path to fame and the Duke's attention.

Early in March, Marie learns that the Duke of Hamilton's yacht has left Nice eight days earlier, meaning he has departed without her ever having been properly introduced to him. This news devastates her:

- She expresses rage and despair at being "ignored" by him

- Laments having no purpose for her promenades and social appearances

- Imagines him in Paris, planning to somehow see him there

- Compares her feelings to those for someone who has died

A transformative moment occurs on March 9 when Marie sings for the Howard children and receives enthusiastic praise. This experience leads to an epiphany:

- She realizes her voice could make her a celebrated singer (cantatrice)

- Envisions a career that would bring her fame, admiration, and social power

- Believes this path could ultimately win the Duke's attention and love

- Sees this as divinely inspired - God showing her how to achieve her desires

- Reconciles her aristocratic status with a performing career by emphasizing her noble birth

Marie's feelings about Boreel remain complicated:

- She criticizes him for imitating the Duke's lifestyle without having the means

- Expresses disappointment at his visits to Monaco and rumors of his behavior there

- Admits to missing seeing him on the promenade

- Notes with satisfaction when he looks at her admiringly

- Strategizes about appearing indifferent to increase his interest

On March 11, Marie's mother suffers what appears to be a nervous attack:

- The family fears for her life momentarily

- Marie describes this as "the strongest emotion I have ever experienced"

- Multiple doctors are called

- By the following day, her mother is improving but still bedridden

- The incident reveals Marie's genuine attachment to her mother despite her self-absorption

Marie continues her regular social routine:

- Daily promenades (on foot, in carriages, or occasionally on horseback)

- Theater and opera attendance (including Verdi's "La Forza del Destino" and "Lucia di Lammermoor")

- Family's Monday reception day

- Visits to and from acquaintances

- Photography session at Shier's studio

- **Duke of Hamilton** - The primary object of Marie's romantic obsession, who has now left Nice

- **Alfred Boreel** - Young man who continues to interest Marie despite her criticisms

- **Gioia** - Woman associated with the Duke, presumed to have left Nice with him

- **The Howard family** - Social connections whose children's admiration of Marie's singing inspires her career ambitions

- **Mlle Collignon** - Marie's teacher, who earns praise for her helpfulness during the mother's health crisis

- **Maman** (Marie's mother) - Suffers a health crisis that briefly shifts Marie's focus from romantic concerns

- **Count Gabrielli** - Social acquaintance who inadvertently delivers the news of the Duke's departure

- **Paris** - Where Marie believes the Duke has gone, and where she hopes to see him at the Bois de Boulogne

- **Monaco** - Described as a "cursed place" and "awful abyss" that corrupts young men like Boreel

- **The Italian and French Theaters** - Venues for performances Marie attends

- **The Howard residence** - Where Marie's singing talent is recognized and celebrated

The March entries reveal significant aspects of Marie's psychology:

- Her tendency to dramatize emotions while simultaneously analyzing them

- Her strategic thinking about social and romantic situations

- Her ability to quickly pivot from disappointment to new ambitions

- Her religious framework for understanding events and desires

- Her self-awareness about her appearance and effect on others

- Her class consciousness and social ambitions

- Her later self-criticism (evident in marginal notes added in 1874)

1. **The Duke's Departure** - Forces Marie to confront the unlikelihood of her romantic fantasy

2. **Discovery of Vocal Talent** - Provides a new direction for her ambitions

3. **Mother's Health Crisis** - Momentarily shifts Marie's focus from romantic concerns to family

4. **Career Ambitions** - Marie begins to envision herself as a celebrated singer while maintaining her social status

These entries provide valuable insights into:

- The conclusion of the winter social season in Nice

- The importance of proper introductions and social protocols in aristocratic circles

- The tension between aristocratic values and artistic careers for women

- The perception of Monaco as a place of moral corruption

- The cultural significance of opera and theater in 1870s European society

March 13 marks the beginning of Marie's third notebook, with her own annotation from 1874 calling the end of the previous book "stupide." The new notebook continues with intensified romantic obsessions and social observations.

Marie's feelings toward Boreel undergo a complete transformation:

- March 16: Admits she still feels "something" but only "remnants of past love"

- March 21: Treats arithmetic lesson as test - if completed without help, she'll become Duchess

- March 25 & 29: Repeatedly vows to God not to strain her voice

- Maintains faith that God will somehow unite her with the Duke despite distance

**March 13** - Beginning of Carnet N° 3; promises God to stop thinking about Boreel

**March 22** - Discovers Duke is in Naples through Swiss Times

**March 24** - Collignon's complaint letter; learns of Gioia's arrangements

**March 27** - Duke confirmed as Tir commissioner; views stereoscope photos

**March 30** - Dreams of Duke visiting and mentioning Berthe

**March 31** - Plans to befriend elite families; hopes villa purchase will help

The complete March 1873 entries show Marie navigating between romantic despair and determined hope. While the Duke's absence forces her to confront reality, she maintains faith in divine intervention and develops increasingly elaborate strategies to achieve her goals. The month ends with Marie preparing for the April pigeon shooting competition, her last hope for the season.

This experience would influence her approach to future relationships and her understanding of her place in society.
