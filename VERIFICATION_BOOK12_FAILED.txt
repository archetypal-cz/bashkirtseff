   Total IDs expected: 1662
   MISSING IDs: 31 gaps
   
   Gap locations:
   - 23-29 (7 missing) - Early June
   - 251-262 (12 missing) - Early July
   - 297-300 (4 missing) - Mid July
   - Multiple single-ID gaps scattered throughout August-April

✗ CHECK 5: SEQUENTIAL CONTINUITY - PROBLEM FILES
   Status: FAIL - 7 files have severe issues
   
   1878-06-25.md: IDs jump (12.22 → 12.30)
   1878-06-26.md: IDs out of order (12.31-32, then 12.33-40, then 12.32)
   1878-06-27.md: IDs BACKWARDS (12.41 → 12.39)
   1878-07-06.md: RESET to 12.01-12 instead of continuing; then jump to 12.263-275
   1878-07-11.md: RESET to 12.01-05 instead of continuing; then jump to 12.302
   1878-08-15 to 1878-08-19: Multiple overlapping IDs across 5 files

✓ CHECK 6: TOTAL PARAGRAPH COUNT
   Status: PARTIAL - 1631 unique IDs found
   Expected: 1662 paragraphs
   Actual: 1631 unique IDs (with 26 duplicates)
   
   Mathematical issue:
   - Total ID occurrences: 1657 (1631 unique + 26 duplicates)
   - Missing 5 paragraphs

==============================================================================
DETAILED PROBLEM SUMMARY
==============================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES (Must be fixed):

1. EARLY JUNE FAILURES (1878-06-25 to 1878-06-27)
   - 1878-06-25: Jump from 12.22 to 12.30 (missing 12.23-29)
   - 1878-06-26: Reverse ordering (12.31-40 mixed, ends with 12.32)
   - 1878-06-27: BACKWARDS progression (12.41 to 12.39)
   
   Impact: 7 missing IDs, 3 files with invalid ordering

2. RESET EVENTS - Multiple files restart from 12.01
   - 1878-07-06: Contains 12.01-12.12 (WRONG - should be ~12.251+)
   - 1878-07-11: Contains 12.01-12.05 (WRONG - should be ~12.251+)
   
   Both files then jump to correct range (263-275 and 302 respectively)
   Indicates partial or broken renumbering process

3. AUGUST OVERLAPS (1878-08-15 to 1878-08-19)
   - 5 files with complex ID overlaps
   - Example: 12.501-508 appears in multiple files
   - Suggests merge conflicts or incomplete renumbering

4. SCATTERED GAPS
   - Gap at 251-262 (12 missing IDs) in early July
   - Single-ID gaps throughout August-April (11 more gaps)

==============================================================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
==============================================================================

The renumbering process has FAILED. Evidence:

1. Duplicate IDs in multiple files (should be unique per file)
2. Reset events (12.01 appearing in July when it should be much higher)
3. Backward ID sequences (12.41 followed by 12.39)
4. Mixed old and new IDs in same file (12.01-12.12 then jump to 12.263)
5. Missing 31 IDs from the sequence
6. 26 duplicate occurrences

Hypothesis: The renumbering script either:
- Ran incompletely or was interrupted
- Had a bug that caused resets at file boundaries
- Did a partial merge leaving old IDs mixed with new ones
- Failed to handle complex date/content transitions

VERIFICATION SUMMARY
==============================================================================

RESULT: FAIL ✗

The paragraph ID renumbering for Book 12 was NOT SUCCESSFUL.

Check Results:
  1. First entry starts at 12.01          ✓ PASS
  2. Last entry ends at 12.1662          ✓ PASS
  3. Format and consistency               ✗ FAIL (26 duplicates found)
  4. Gap detection                        ✗ FAIL (31 gaps in sequence)
  5. Sequential continuity                ✗ FAIL (7 problem files)
  6. Total paragraph count                ✗ FAIL (only 1631 of 1662 unique)

CONCLUSION:
Book 12 paragraph IDs have NOT been successfully standardized. The renumbering
process has created multiple critical issues including duplicate IDs, missing
IDs, and files with out-of-order paragraph sequences. This requires a complete
re-do of the renumbering process.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Do not use current Book 12 files for translation/compilation
- Restore from backup or re-run renumbering process with corrections
- Add validation checks to prevent similar failures
- Manually verify all IDs are sequential across all 309 files before declaring success
