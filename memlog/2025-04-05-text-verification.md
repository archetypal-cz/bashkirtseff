# Text Verification: Book 2 Raw File vs. Individual Day Entries

Date: 2025-04-05

## Task Completed
Verified that the text in individual day entries in src/_original/02/ matches exactly with the corresponding text in the raw file src/_original/02_carnet_raw.md.

## Methodology
Randomly selected and compared three entries:
- August 11, 1873 (Lundi 11 août 1873)
- August 15, 1873 (Vendredi 15 août 1873)
- August 21, 1873 (Jeudi 21 août 1873)

## Findings

1. **Text Accuracy**: The text content in the individual day entries matches exactly with the corresponding sections in the raw file. There are no discrepancies, omissions, or additions to the actual diary text.

2. **Formatting Consistency**: The formatting, including paragraph breaks, quotations, and special notations like "[Rayé: La robe de Dina.]" (indicating crossed-out text in the original), has been preserved accurately.

3. **Proper Additions**: The only additions to the individual files are:
   - Paragraph IDs in the format `[//]: # ( 02.XX )` which serve as reference markers
   - Researcher notes (RSR) in some files that provide historical context but are clearly marked as separate from the original text with timestamps

4. **Special Characters**: Special formatting like italics (e.g., *Reboux*, *promenade*) has been preserved correctly.

5. **Dialogue Format**: Dialogue formatting with dashes is consistent between the raw file and individual entries.

## Conclusion
The splitting of the raw file into individual day entries has been done with high fidelity to the original text. There are no AI hallucinations or discrepancies between the original text and the split files. The project maintains excellent textual integrity while adding useful organizational elements like paragraph IDs and occasional historical context notes that are clearly distinguished from the original content.
