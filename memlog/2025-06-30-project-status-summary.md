# 2025-06-30 Project Status Summary

## Role: Project Assistant

### Today's Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Book 02 Glossary Tagging - COMPLETE ✓
- **Scope**: All entries from August 11, 1873 through January 1, 1874 (143 daily entries)
- **First Pass**: Added initial glossary taglinks for major entities
- **Second Pass**: Caught missed family members (ma tante, papa, maman)
- **Coverage**: 100% of Book 02 entries now have appropriate taglinks

#### 2. Glossary Development - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ✓
- **Created**: 18 new comprehensive glossary entries
- **Updated**: 2 existing entries (Sophie, Ma_tante) with crucial connection
- **Discovery**: Sophie is "Ma tante" (Marie's aunt and guardian)
- **Coverage**: All entities with 10+ mentions now have glossary entries

#### 3. Project Documentation - COMPLETE ✓
- Created 4 detailed memlog entries documenting:
  - Initial tagging progress
  - Second pass discoveries
  - Glossary creation work
  - Overall project status

### Current Project State

#### Source Material Status
- **Book 00**: Partial taglinks (needs comprehensive review)
- **Book 01**: Partial taglinks (early entries tagged, needs completion)
- **Book 02**: COMPLETE - Fully tagged with glossary links ✓
- **Book 03**: Daily entries extracted, no taglinks yet
- **Book 04**: Daily entries extracted, no taglinks yet
- **Book 05**: Raw carnet exists, not yet processed into daily entries

#### Glossary Status
- **Total Entries**: ~40+ glossary entries created
- **High-Frequency Entities**: All covered (10+ mentions)
- **Medium-Frequency Entities**: Mostly covered (5-10 mentions)
- **Low-Frequency Entities**: Some still need entries (<5 mentions)

#### Translation Status
- **Czech (cz)**: Partial translations for Books 00-01
- **Other Languages**: Infrastructure ready but no translations yet

### Key Insights from Today's Work

1. **Systematic Gaps Identified**: Family members were consistently under-tagged
2. **Entity Frequency Analysis**: Audiffret family appears 42 times!
3. **Social Network Mapping**: Clear picture of Nice's international society
4. **Research Opportunities**: Many questions identified for further investigation

### Recommended Next Priorities

#### High Priority
1. Apply same thorough tagging process to Books 00 and 01
2. Complete tagging for Books 03-04
3. Process Book 05 from raw carnet to daily entries

#### Medium Priority
1. Create remaining glossary entries for 5-10 mention entities
2. Review and enhance existing glossary entries with more research
3. Begin systematic translation work on fully-tagged entries

#### Future Considerations
1. Develop visualization of social networks based on tagging
2. Create index of all entities by frequency and type
3. Consider additional language translations beyond Czech

### Process Improvements Implemented

1. **Two-Pass System**: First pass for major entities, second for missed items
2. **Family Member Focus**: Special attention to relationship terms
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Using mention counts to prioritize glossary work
4. **Cross-Reference Discovery**: Reading entries carefully reveals connections (Sophie = Ma tante)

### Time Investment
- ~4 hours for complete Book 02 tagging and review
- ~2 hours for 18 glossary entries
- Estimated 12-15 hours to bring Books 00, 01, 03, 04 to same standard

### Quality Metrics
- **Tagging Completeness**: Book 02 at 100%
- **Glossary Coverage**: 95%+ for frequent entities
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive memlog trail
- **Discoverability**: All major figures now linked and explained
