## Tagging Pattern Established

Taglinks format: `[//]: # ( [#Entity_Name](/src/_original/_glossary/Entity_Name.md) )`
- Placed above paragraphs where entities first appear or play significant roles
- Multiple entities on same line when contextually related
- Avoided over-tagging by not repeating for minor mentions

## Key Recurring Entities in Book 02

**People:**
- Duke of Hamilton (obsession throughout)
- Gioia (Hamilton's mistress)
- Family: Paul, Dina, Maman, Walitsky
- Companions: Bete, Boreel, Hitchcock
- Society: Vicomtesse Vigier, Miloradovitch, Elder

**Places:**
- Monte Carlo/Monaco
- Villa Baquis
- London House
- Baden-Baden
- Vienna World Exhibition
- Paris locations (House of Worth, Ferry, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. Process Book 00 entries (1884) for taglinks
2. Complete remaining Book 01 entries
3. Check Books 03-04 for tagging status
4. Create missing glossary entries for new entities discovered
