# Research Status for Books 03 and 04

**Date**: 2025-07-05
**Purpose**: Assessment of research completion for Books 03 and 04

## Summary

Both Book 03 and Book 04 have been extracted into individual daily entries but are **NOT ready for translation** due to incomplete research. According to the Claude.md guidelines, comprehensive research must precede translation.

## Book 03 Status (January 2 - July 4, 1874)

### What's Complete:
- ✅ All 185 daily entries extracted
- ✅ Basic RSR summary comments at end of each entry
- ✅ Original French text preserved in comments
- ✅ Paragraph numbering system

### What's Missing:
- ❌ NO hashtag links above paragraphs
- ❌ Many glossary entries not created
- ❌ Limited historical context in RSR comments
- ❌ No linguistic analysis notes
- ❌ Cultural references not explained

### Entities Needing Glossary Entries:
- Princesse Souvoroff
- Marquise Viviani
- Basilévitch family
- Eristoff
- Harzinski
- Multiple aristocratic families
- Theater/opera references

## Book 04 Status (July 5, 1874 - April 2, 1875)

### What's Complete:
- ✅ All ~270 daily entries extracted
- ✅ RSR comments present (but basic)
- ✅ About 15 files in late August 1874 fully researched with hashtags

### What's Missing:
- ❌ Hashtag links missing from ~255 files
- ❌ Many glossary entries not created
- ❌ Historical context insufficient
- ❌ Linguistic phenomena not documented
- ❌ Cultural references unexplained

### Well-Researched Example:
File **1874-08-20.md** shows proper research:
```markdown
[//]: # ( [#Plobster](/src/_original/_glossary/Plobster.md) [#Ostende](/src/_original/_glossary/Ostende.md) )

Maman part ce soir pour Ostende, où je suis sûre qu'elle rencontrera cet odieux plobster.

[//]: # ( 2025-04-05T03:45:00 RSR: Linguistic note - Marie seems uncertain about spelling "plobster" )
```

## Required Research Tasks

### 1. Hashtag Linking (High Priority)
- Add hashtag links above ALL paragraphs containing entities
- Format: `[//]: # ( [#Entity_Name](/src/_original/_glossary/Entity_Name.md) )`
- Estimated: 455 files need hashtag links added

### 2. Glossary Creation (High Priority)
- Create comprehensive entries for all people, places, concepts
- Include research status and last updated date
- Cross-reference with other diary entries
- Estimated: 100+ new glossary entries needed

### 3. RSR Enhancement (Medium Priority)
- Add historical context beyond summaries
- Include cultural and literary references
- Document linguistic phenomena
- Add cross-references to related entries

### 4. Linguistic Analysis (Medium Priority)
- Document Marie's language errors
- Note code-switching between languages
- Identify wordplay and neologisms
- Mark when she creates her own expressions

## Examples of Missing Research

### Book 03 - January 15, 1874:
Mentions aristocrats without context:
- Prince Harzinski (who is he?)
- Vicomtesse Vigier (relationship to Marie?)
- Prince de Chimay (historical figure?)
- Duchesse de Mouchy (significance?)

### Book 04 - December 25, 1874:
References without explanation:
- "Le voyage de M. Perrichon" (what play?)
- Nice society dynamics unexplained
- Christmas customs of the period

## Recommendation

Before any translation work proceeds:

1. **Complete hashtag linking** - This is the minimum requirement
2. **Create all glossary entries** - Essential for translator understanding
3. **Add linguistic notes** - Critical for capturing Marie's voice
4. **Research cultural context** - Necessary for accurate translation

The late August 1874 entries (around 1874-08-20) serve as the gold standard for what complete research looks like. All entries should match this level of detail.

## Time Estimate

- Hashtag linking: 2-3 days of focused work
- Glossary creation: 5-7 days with research
- RSR enhancement: 3-4 days
- Total: 10-14 days to bring both books to translation-ready status

Without this research, translators will miss nuances, cultural references, and Marie's linguistic playfulness - all essential to capturing her authentic voice.
