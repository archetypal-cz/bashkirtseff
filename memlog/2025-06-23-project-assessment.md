# Project Assessment and Claude.md Update
Date: 2025-06-23

## Current State Assessment

### Completed Work
- Book 0: May 1-10, 1884 entries processed
- Book 1: January 11 - March 12, 1873 entries processed  
- Book 2: August 11 - September 23, 1873 entries processed
- Czech translations exist for Book 0 (preface) and partial Book 1 (through Feb 12, 1873)

### Gaps Identified
- Book 1: Missing March 13 - August 10, 1873 (approximately 5 months)
- Book 2: Missing September 24 - December 31, 1873 (approximately 3 months)
- Some individual dates appear skipped in processed months

### Infrastructure Updates
Updated Claude.md with:
1. Specific day entry processing instructions for raw carnets
2. Automated workflow guidelines for continuous processing
3. Clear format specifications for daily entry files
4. Batch processing guidelines (10-15 entries at a time)
5. Session handoff procedures for continuity

### Next Steps
Priority 1: Continue processing Book 1 from March 13, 1873
- Raw text available in /src/_original/01_carnet_raw.md
- Process in monthly batches
- Create summary files for each completed month

## Technical Notes
- Media files exist for December 1873 entries (PNGs)
- Hashtags London_House and Miloradovitch need HASHTAGS.md entries
- TranslationMemory.md should be updated with new terms as processing continues

## Recommendations
1. Process entries systematically by month
2. Update todo list after each batch
3. Create monthly summaries as each month completes
4. Document any date anomalies or missing entries
5. Note position in raw file for easy resumption
