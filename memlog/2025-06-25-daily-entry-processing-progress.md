## Notes
Marie's diary becomes increasingly introspective as Hamilton's wedding approaches. Her physical descriptions of him become more grotesque even as her emotional attachment deepens. The arrival of Miss Hitchcock provides comic relief but also reveals Marie's defensive strategies about her feelings.
