## Summary

Completed comprehensive research, hashtag linking, and glossary creation for two pivotal entries in Marie's diary: her first wedding attendance (Filimonoff wedding) and preparations for her first masked ball, revealing intensifying social anxieties and violent fantasies.

## February 11, 1874 - Filimonoff Wedding

### Completed Work
- **Hashtag Links Added**: 10 entities systematically tagged
- **New Glossary Entries Created**: 4
  - `Katia.md` - Daughter of Prince Bagration, bride
  - `Azarevitch.md` - Acquaintance from Gavotti's house
  - `Bec.md` - Wedding attendee who becomes regular in diary
  - `Koulichoff.md` - Another Russian Orthodox wedding guest
- **Enhanced RSR Comment**: Added detailed linguistic and cultural analysis including:
  - Russian Orthodox wedding customs and significance
  - Marie's role as outsider (Roman Catholic at Orthodox ceremony)
  - Analysis of her language when discussing religious ceremonies
  - First major social event attendance documented

### Key Observations
- Marie's first recorded wedding attendance marks social debut
- Complex relationship with Russian Orthodox community evident
- Mixture of fascination and alienation with religious customs
- Social positioning anxiety emerges ("je n'étais pas invitée")

## February 12, 1874 - Masked Ball Preparations

### Completed Work
- **Hashtag Links Added**: 12 entities systematically tagged
- **New Glossary Entries Created**: 5
  - `Lambertye.md` - Young man who embarrasses Marie (violent fantasy target)
  - `Galve.md` - Marquis de Galve, Spanish nobleman
  - `Labanoff.md` - Russian family at social events
  - `Zveguinzoff.md` - Russian-Italian noble family
  - `Bussi.md` - Italian family, possible spelling variant of Bussy
- **Enhanced RSR Comment**: Comprehensive analysis of:
  - Social anxiety and class consciousness intensifying
  - First masked ball excitement (pierrot costume)
  - Violent fantasy about Lambertye ("je le tuerais")
  - Material desires and shopping patterns

### Linguistic Analysis
- **Crossed-out text documented**: "Il y a des" (showing self-censorship)
- **Marginal comment preserved**: Date correction showing diary revision
- **Code-switching**: French-Italian when discussing social events
- **Violence language**: Escalation from embarrassment to murder fantasy

## Key Themes Emerging

### 1. Russian Orthodox Community Relations
- Attends ceremonies but remains outsider
- Fascinated by rituals but maintains distance
- Social connections primarily through Russian nobility
- Religious differences create subtle barriers

### 2. Social Position Anxiety
- Obsessive tracking of who acknowledges her
- Violent reactions to perceived slights
- Constant comparison with other young women
- Fear of being overlooked or dismissed

### 3. First Major Social Events
- Wedding attendance marks new phase
- Masked ball represents fantasy fulfillment
- Pierrot costume choice significant (commedia dell'arte)
- Events become central to diary narrative

### 4. Material Desires and Shopping
- Detailed accounts of purchases
- Mother's spending becomes source of conflict
- Fashion as social armor
- Shopping as emotional outlet

### 5. Violent Fantasies
- Lambertye incident triggers murder fantasy
- Pattern of extreme reactions to male slights
- Violence as response to powerlessness
- Fantasies recorded then partially censored

## Technical Implementation

### Hashtag System
- Total hashtags added: 22 across both entries
- All entities now properly linked to glossary
- Consistent formatting maintained
- Links placed above relevant paragraphs

### Glossary Entries
- 9 new comprehensive entries created
- Research status marked as "Comprehensive"
- Cross-references added between related entries
- Historical context provided where available

### RSR Comments
- Both entries now have detailed researcher analysis
- Linguistic peculiarities documented
- Cultural context explained
- Psychological insights provided

## Next Steps
- Continue with February 13-14 entries
- Track Lambertye appearances (potential recurring conflict)
- Monitor masked ball outcome (February 13 likely)
- Document any Russian Orthodox events attendance
- Note evolution of violent fantasy patterns

## Notes
- February 11-12 marks transition to more socially active period
- Violent fantasies appearing earlier than previously noted
- Russian Orthodox/Catholic divide more significant than expected
- Material culture (shopping, fashion) central to identity formation
- These entries crucial for understanding later social dynamics
