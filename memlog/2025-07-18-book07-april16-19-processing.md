## Psychological Narrative Arc

### The Telegram Crisis (April 17)
The crucial moment when Marie overhears Altamura's telegram confirming Pietro is in Rome. This transforms her from hopeful waiting to devastating realization of betrayal. The "hair barometer" detail ("as long as I'm happy my hair curls admirably") shows her physical embodiment of emotional states.

### Archaeological Symbolism (April 18)
The Pompeii visit becomes a profound meditation on marriage, destruction, and burial. Marie's comparison of marriage to volcanic eruption reveals her complex relationship with domestic expectations. The Hamilton mysticism returns with full force - "my god on earth, material god, profane god."

### Literary Ambition (April 19)
Marie's declaration of literary legacy shows her awareness of the diary's historical value. The 1881 self-annotation critiquing her own "fatiguing exaggeration and romanticism" demonstrates her later editorial perspective on this period.
