# 2025-06-30 Second Pass Tagging Progress

## Summary
Conducting a thorough second pass on Book 02 to catch missed entity tags and create missing glossary entries.

## Missing Entities Identified

### Most Frequently Missed
1. **"ma tante"** (Marie's aunt) - appeared in many entries without tags
2. **"papa"** (Constantin Bashkirtseff) - frequently mentioned without tags  
3. **"maman"** - some instances missed despite having glossary entry
4. **Religious references** ("Dieu", "Christ") - consistently untagged
5. **Secondary characters** - Makaroff, Berthe, various society figures

## Glossary Entries Created

### New Entries Added
1. **Ma_tante.md** - Marie's devoted aunt who served as primary guardian
2. **Papa.md** - Constantin Bashkirtseff, Marie's father
3. **Makaroff.md** - Marie's teacher, "excellent professor" but socially awkward

### Entries Still Needed
- Berthe (potential rival for Duke of Hamilton)
- Marie Ivanovna Perlik (warned Marie's mother about marriage)
- Wittgenstein (society figure with villa)
- Anitchkoff family
- Grand-papa (grandfather)
- Provençaux (Vienna restaurant)
- Various other society figures

## Tagging Improvements Made

### August 1873
- Added Ma_tante tags to 1873-08-11 (4 instances)
- Fixed missing tags for recurring mentions

### September 1873  
- Added comprehensive tags to 1873-09-01 including:
  - Ma_tante, Papa, Maman mentions
  - Makaroff, Berthe, Marie Ivanovna Perlik
  - Grand-papa, Monaco, Anitchkoff

### October 1873
- 1873-10-01: Added 12 Maman, 3 Ma_tante, 1 Papa tags
- 1873-10-05: Added 8 Maman tags
- Many October entries still need second pass review

## Patterns Discovered

### Why Tags Were Missed
1. **Family members** - Common terms like "ma tante", "papa" overlooked
2. **Multiple mentions** - Only first mention tagged, later ones missed
3. **Dialogue sections** - Entities in quoted speech often missed
4. **Minor characters** - One-time mentions not consistently tagged

### Tagging Best Practices Reinforced
- Tag ALL significant mentions, not just first appearance
- Include family relationship terms (ma tante, papa, grand-papa)
- Tag entities in dialogue when they're the subject of discussion
- Create glossary entries for any repeatedly mentioned person/place

## Important Discovery
- **Sophie = Ma tante**: December entries confirm that Sophie is Marie's aunt ("ma tante")
- Updated both glossary entries to reflect this connection

## Additional Tags Added in Second Pass

### October Entries
- Added Papa tags: 1873-10-10, 10-20, 10-25, 10-30
- Added Maman tags: 1873-10-10

### November Entries  
- Added Ma_tante/Sophie tags: 1873-11-15
- Added Papa tags: 1873-11-15, 11-25
- Added many character tags: Sacco, Plantus, Howard family members, teachers, etc.

### December Entries
- Added Sophie tags where "ma tante" mentioned: 1873-12-15, 12-25
- Added Maman tags: 1873-12-05, 12-25
- Confirmed Sophie-Ma_tante connection

## Entities Still Needing Glossary Entries

- Various teachers: Brunet, Lemp, Manotte, M. Leclerc
- Society figures: Solominka, Durocher, Gagarine
- Howard family members: Willy, Helene, Lise, Aggie
- Many others identified during second pass

## Next Steps
1. Create remaining glossary entries for frequently mentioned people
2. Apply same thorough second pass to Books 00, 01, 03-04
3. Ensure all family member mentions are tagged throughout
