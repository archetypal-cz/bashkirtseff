# Project Status: 2025-03-23

## Current Progress

The Coslate Bashkirtseff project is a translation of Marie Bashkirtseff's diary from French to Czech. The project currently includes:

- Translation of diary entries from January and February 1873
- Monthly summaries for January and February 1873
- Style guidelines for general translation and Czech-specific considerations
- A comprehensive hashtag system for cross-referencing people, places, and concepts

## Project Structure Assessment

### Strengths
- Well-organized source and translation files in src/_original and src/cz directories
- Detailed monthly summaries providing context for translators
- Clear style guidelines in prompts/Style.md and prompts/Style.cz.md
- Comprehensive hashtag system in src/HASHTAGS.md

### Gaps Identified
1. Missing Plan.md in root directory to track overall progress
2. Empty memlog directory (this is the first entry)
3. Empty docs directory - should contain:
   - Translation memory (Memory.md)
   - Reference materials
   - Grammar guidelines for Czech
4. No VSCode tasks for compilation and preview
5. No Poetry configuration for Python tools
6. No compilation scripts in the bin directory

## Immediate Tasks

1. Create a proper Plan.md file in the root directory (requires switching to a mode with appropriate permissions)
2. Create a translation memory file in docs/Memory.md
3. Set up a docs/grammar directory with Czech grammar guidelines
4. Develop VSCode tasks for compilation
5. Set up Poetry for Python package management
6. Create compilation scripts

## Translation Progress

- January 1873: Complete
- February 1873: Complete
- March 1873: Not started (need to check if source files exist)

## Next Steps

1. Review existing translations for consistency
2. Check for any March 1873 entries that need translation
3. Implement technical infrastructure for compilation
4. Create a translation memory based on completed work
