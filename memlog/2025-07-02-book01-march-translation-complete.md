## Key Editorial Improvements

1. **Breaking up long paragraphs** - Made text more readable and dynamic
2. **Youthful language** - Replaced formal expressions with Marie's spontaneous voice
3. **Emotional intensity** - Enhanced dramatic moments (e.g., "Strašně ho to vyvedlo z míry!")
4. **Cultural clarity** - Added footnotes for Baden-Baden, foreign language passages
5. **Natural Czech flow** - Avoided literal translations that sound awkward

## Technical Decisions

- Foreign language passages (English) marked with ==highlight==^[1] syntax
- Footnotes explain original language: *V originále anglicky:*
- Marginal notes preserved in brackets: [Na okraji: ...]
- Crossed-out text noted: [Přeškrtnuto: ...]
- Italics preserved for emphasis: *hádaly se*

## Character Voice Consistency

- Marie: Passionate, dramatic, self-aware teenager
- Boreel: Object of conflicted feelings, criticized for imitating Duke
- Duke of Hamilton: Distant ideal, true love
- Mlle Collignon: Increasingly difficult governess
- Gioia: Sophisticated courtesan holding Duke's attention
