# Claude.md Linguistic Analysis Update
Date: 2025-07-03

## Update Made
Added important guidance for the Researcher role regarding linguistic analysis in the CLAUDE.md file.

## New Requirements for Researcher Role
The Researcher must now identify and document when Marie:
- Makes errors in French or other languages (spelling, grammar, vocabulary)
- Plays with words (puns, wordplay, neologisms)
- Code-switches between languages
- Uses non-standard expressions or creates her own phrases
- Shows her age through linguistic choices

## Rationale
This is critical for translators to understand Marie's linguistic playfulness and mistakes, enabling them to make informed decisions about how to handle these instances in translation. Without this context, translators might:
- "Correct" intentional wordplay
- Miss the significance of her linguistic errors showing her youth
- Fail to recreate her playful voice in the target language

## Implementation
These findings should be documented with RSR (Researcher) comments in the original source files, providing translators with the necessary context to preserve Marie's authentic voice.
