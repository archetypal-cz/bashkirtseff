## Issues Found and Patterns

### Major Issues
1. **Content Wrapped in Comments**: Entries 1878-06-29, 1878-06-30, 1878-07-01 had content improperly wrapped in `[//]: # ( content )` format - needed unwrapping
2. **Missing Hashtag Links**: All entries missing systematic hashtag identification
3. **Missing Paragraph IDs**: No systematic paragraph numbering
4. **Missing RSR Comments**: No researcher analysis

### Minor Issues
1. **Transcription Errors**: Few minor typos like "ave" instead of "avec"
2. **Formatting Inconsistencies**: Em-dash vs hyphen usage
3. **Name Variations**: Some proper nouns need standardization

### Content Patterns
- Marie's obsession with Paul de Cassagnac dominates these entries
- Detailed social scenes (opera, salons, family conversations)
- Political discussions about Bonapartism
- Psychological self-analysis reaches sophisticated levels
- References to art lessons with Robert-Fleury and Julian

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Continue with 1878-07-02 through 1878-07-15 (Batch 2)
2. Check for more entries with wrapped content
3. Systematic hashtag identification for each entry
4. Continue paragraph ID numbering from 12.139+

### Methodology
- Read each entry to identify all entities (people, places, events)
- Add hashtag links at top with #Paris first (Marie's location)
- Add paragraph IDs systematically
- Add comprehensive RSR comments analyzing historical/psychological context
- Fix obvious transcription errors
- Document special issues in memlog

## Current Paragraph ID Counter
**Last used**: 12.139 (in 1878-07-01)
**Next available**: 12.140

## Estimated Remaining Work
- **Total entries**: ~223 remaining
- **Estimated time per entry**: 3-5 minutes for simple, 10-15 for complex
- **Challenge**: Some entries may have content wrapped in comments requiring unwrapping

## Quality Standards Applied
- First hashtag always Marie's location (usually #Paris for Book 12)
- Comprehensive entity identification
- Period-accurate transcription preservation
- Detailed historical/psychological RSR analysis
- Systematic paragraph ID progression
