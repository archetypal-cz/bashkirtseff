   - Lists aristocratic encounters and social observations

   - Documents the "Chevalier Edouard de Moelenar"
   - First real example of Marie's "Plobster" terminology
   - Shows evolution of term from admiration to mockery
   - Details August 29 introduction after 15 days of posing

3. **Plobster.md**
   - Explains Marie's invented code word
   - Traces evolution from Spa to Ostende usage
   - Shows shift from attractive men to objects of ridicule

### Key Findings

- Marie's "Plobster" terminology evolved from admiration to mockery
- Her Hamilton obsession intensified rather than diminished over time
- Ostende served as important social laboratory for her observations
- The torn-out pages (August 29) suggest censored content
- Marie's linguistic creativity shown through invented vocabulary

### Research Notes

- The Comte de Mulinare/Moelenar may warrant further historical research
- The "Carlo Hamilton" racing reference needs investigation
- The torn pages incident deserves notation in affected entries
- Marie's code-switching and language play becoming more evident

### Next Steps

- Continue processing August 1874 entries for additional entities
- Research historical records for Comte de Mulinare
- Investigate "Carlo Hamilton" racing connection
- Document other recurring Ostende society figures
