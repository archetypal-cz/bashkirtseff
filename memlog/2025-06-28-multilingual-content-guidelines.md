# Multilingual Content Guidelines - 2025-06-28

## Summary

Established new guidelines for handling Marie's multilingual writing in translations.

## The Issue

Marie Bashkirtseff was highly educated and cosmopolitan, often incorporating English, Italian, Russian, and other languages into her French diary entries. We need to preserve this multilingual aspect while making the text accessible to Czech readers.

## New Guidelines Implemented

1. **Translate foreign phrases** that Marie uses within her French text
2. **Mark translations** with ==double equals highlighting==
3. **Add footnotes** indicating original language and text:
   ```markdown
   ==Czech translation==[^1]
   
   [^1]: *V originále anglicky:* "original English phrase"
   ```

## Example Applied

In 1873-02-17, Marie wrote in English: "I did not mean what I meant before"

**Before**: Left in English or translated without marking
**After**: ==už nemyslím to, co jsem předtím myslela==[^2]

With footnote: [^2]: *V originále anglicky:* "I did not mean what I meant before"

## Languages to Watch For

- **English**: Educational phrases, emotional expressions
- **Italian**: Musical/artistic terms, phrases from lessons
- **Russian**: Family expressions, cultural references
- **German**: Possibly in later entries (spa towns, etc.)

## Benefits

1. Preserves Marie's cosmopolitan voice
2. Shows her linguistic sophistication
3. Makes text accessible to Czech readers
4. Maintains scholarly accuracy
5. Highlights code-switching as part of her identity
