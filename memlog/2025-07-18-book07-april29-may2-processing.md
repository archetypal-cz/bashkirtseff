## Psychological Narrative Arc

### The Post-Intimacy Void (April 29-30)
Marie's elevation of the kiss to sacred status creates impossible romantic expectations. Her sophisticated inheritance analysis of the Antonelli fortune contrasts with emotional vulnerability about Pietro's silence. The "invisible little strings" metaphor captures both physical and psychological connection theories.

### The Domestic Prison (May 1-2)
Marie's brutal analysis of family dysfunction provides context for her marriage ambitions. The comparison to "spoiled and surly dogs" and the Yourkoff suicide parallel reveal her awareness of social rejection's lethal potential. Her strategic thinking about Bruschetti vs. Pietro shows sophisticated romantic calculation.

### The Champagne Epiphany (May 2)
The ritual with Giro represents genuine female friendship amid cynical feminine psychology. Marie's "wine smoke" insight about Pietro as "young dog" marks a turning point in romantic realism. Vatican politics and court ambitions merge with personal strategy.
