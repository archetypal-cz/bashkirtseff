### Summary
Added comprehensive hashtag links and RSR comments to Marie Bashkirtseff's diary entries for August 26-31, 1874. This period is significant for several reasons:

1. **Hamilton Obsession**: Marie continues putting "His Grace etc." under her pillow to dream of the Duke of Hamilton
2. **Plobster Identity Revealed**: The mysterious "Plobster" is finally introduced as Chevalier Edouard de Moelenar
3. **Six Torn Pages**: August 29 contains the notation "[Six pages écrites arrachées]" - Marie destroyed 6 pages of writing
4. **Social Dynamics**: Complex interactions with Merjeewsky, Basilewsky, and Basilevitch
5. **Health Issues**: Forced medical examination by King's physician Dr. Winnier

### Key Observations

#### Language and Wordplay
- "jeune coquillage" (young shellfish) - unusual epithet for Merjeewsky
- Code-switching: "I enjoy my bath" (English in French text)
- Marie's private vocabulary spreading: "Plobster," "faquin," code names for furniture
- Vivid similes: family acts "like village dogs when carriage passes"

#### Psychological Insights
- Marie blushes twice before managing to speak about Hamilton (rare vulnerability)
- "I sometimes forget, but I never forgive" - key character trait
- Violent reaction to medical examination: would give them "cane blows"
- Performs for male gaze: floats in ocean because men are watching

#### Social Categories
- Moelenar is "half faquin, half Plobster" - doesn't fit either category
- "Not a real Plobster but amusing as poser"
- Plobster name "ruined" since applied to Moelenar

#### Mystery of Torn Pages
The August 29 entry builds to intense laughter "worse than crazy" then abruptly notes six written pages were torn out. The entry concludes with the bland "Everything happened en famille!" - clearly covering up whatever occurred.

### Entities Requiring Glossary Entries
- Merjeewsky (Count, possibly same as Comte de Mulinare)
- Basilewsky (Russian, witty companion)
- Basilevitch (Married woman who "sends husband away")
- Moelenar (Chevalier Edouard de, aka Plobster)
- Doria Pamphilii (Italian nobleman)
- Foster Family (English, Florence is daughter)
- Baron Leiss
- Bruges (Belgian city, trip destination)
- Cercle des Bains (social venue in Ostende)
- Dr. Winnier (King's physician)
- Koutski (musician giving concert)
- Fanbrantigen (Belgian offering London help)

### Notable Events
- August 26: No Hamilton dream, dinner party of 13
- August 27: Hamilton gossip, stolen glove incident, "terrible storm" at home
- August 28: Dream divination, Merjeewsky's spite
- August 29: Plobster revealed, six pages torn out
- August 30: Dirty shirt scandal, Hamilton sighting
- August 31: Doctor ambush, moonlight serenade with umbrella-guitar

### Research Notes
The period shows Marie at her most socially active but also psychologically vulnerable. The Hamilton obsession intensifies, while complex social maneuvering occurs with various admirers. The torn pages on August 29 remain a significant mystery - what could have prompted such drastic self-censorship?

The entries demonstrate Marie's sophisticated use of language, her acute social observations, and her growing awareness of her effect on men. The medical examination incident reveals her fierce independence and resistance to being controlled or categorized as ill.
