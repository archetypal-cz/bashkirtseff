Today we continued the Czech translation of Marie Bashkirtseff's diary, focusing on the preface sections (00.06.md and 00.11.md). The following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Enhanced Czech Translations:**
   - Added detailed footnotes to file 00.06.md providing historical and cultural context
   - Added detailed footnotes to file 00.11.md explaining social norms and geographical references
   - Improved translation quality with more natural Czech phrasing
   - Maintained consistent formatting with paragraph IDs and researcher comments

2. **Footnote Enhancements:**
   - Added explanatory notes about the Crimean War and Russian nobility
   - Added context about social norms in 19th century Russia
   - Added information about geographical locations mentioned in the text
   - Added explanations of family relationships and social dynamics

3. **Hashtag Integration:**
   - Ensured proper linking of hashtags to glossary entries
   - Maintained consistent hashtag formatting throughout the documents

## Key Translation Decisions

1. **Cultural Context Adaptation:**
   - Added explanatory footnotes for concepts that would be unfamiliar to Czech readers
   - Preserved Russian names with Czech transliteration (e.g., Baškircev instead of Bashkirtseff)
   - Maintained references to Russian locations with appropriate Czech spelling

2. **Stylistic Choices:**
   - Preserved Marie's distinctive voice and narrative style
   - Improved readability while maintaining the author's unique perspective
   - Enhanced clarity of complex family relationships through footnotes

## Pending Tasks

1. **Update HASHTAGS.md:**
   - Add the new hashtags for London_House and Miloradovitch to the main HASHTAGS.md file
   - Ensure alphabetical ordering of all hashtags

2. **Continue Translation Work:**
