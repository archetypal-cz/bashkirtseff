# 2025-06-31 HASHTAGS and Glossary Synchronization

## Summary
As Researcher, I analyzed and updated the HASHTAGS.md file to synchronize with our glossary entries.

## Key Findings

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **HASHTAGS.md had**: 75 entries listed
- **Glossary directory has**: 59 actual files
- **Out of sync**: 42 hashtags without glossary files, 33 glossary files not in hashtags

### Missing Glossary Files (42 entries)
Many entities in HASHTAGS.md lack corresponding glossary files, including:
- **Writers**: Edmond de Goncourt, Guy de Maupassant, Lord Byron, Pushkin, Lermontov
- **Places**: Poltava, St. Petersburg, Crimea, Vienna, Odessa, Yalta, Geneva, etc.
- **People**: Alexander II, many Russian names from Book 00
- **Duplicates**: Walitzky (we have Walitsky)

### Untracked Glossary Files (33 entries)
Many glossary files weren't listed in HASHTAGS.md, including all 17 created today:
- Anitchkoff, Audiffret, Berthe, Gagarine, Grand_papa
- Howard_Family, Ma_tante, Makaroff, Marie_Ivanovna_Perlik, Papa
- Rodionoff, Sacco, Saetone, Solominka, Teachers, Tolstoy, Wittgenstein
- Plus others created earlier

## Actions Taken

### Updated HASHTAGS.md
1. **Reorganized alphabetically** with section headers (A, B, C, etc.)
2. **Added descriptions** for each entry to help users understand context
3. **Included all 59 glossary files** with proper links
4. **Listed missing entries** that still need glossary files
5. **Added helpful context** like mention counts and relationships

### Key Improvements
- Users can now quickly understand who/what each hashtag represents
- Clear indication of which entities still need glossary entries
- Better organization for finding specific entries
- Proper tracking of all created glossary files

## Next Steps
1. Create glossary files for the 42 missing entries (prioritize by frequency)
2. Review Book 00 entries - many hashtags seem to come from there
3. Maintain HASHTAGS.md as new glossary entries are created
4. Consider removing duplicate spellings (Walitzky vs Walitsky)

## Impact
This synchronization ensures researchers and translators can:
- Find all available glossary information
- Understand which entities need research
- Navigate the social world of Marie's diary more easily
- Maintain consistency across the project
