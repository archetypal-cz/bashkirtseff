## Psychological Narrative Arc

### The Larderei Lightning Strike (April 20-23)
Marie's instant fascination with Count Alexandre de Larderei begins with an inexplicable premonition. The train station encounter becomes a "double lightning strike" - she blushes, stammers, and suffers complete romantic devastation while carried away by "this brutal force, this locomotive" as Larderei remains behind with his cocotte.

### The Pietro Confrontation (April 24-25)
The corridor scene represents a complete inversion of romantic power dynamics. Marie's desperate vulnerability meets Pietro's calculated coldness. Her religious bargaining (kneeling for half an hour) is answered, but Pietro has transformed from passionate Petruccio into rational Count Antonelli. The fortress metaphor captures the futility of emotional assault against calculated indifference.

### Aristocratic Intelligence
Throughout this period, Marie demonstrates sophisticated understanding of social hierarchies, financial arrangements, and aristocratic behavior. Her detailed analysis of Neapolitan vs. Roman society, her reading of Torlonia's courtship strategy, and her assessment of the Larderei brothers' social positions show remarkable social intelligence.
