### Researcher Note

Book 01 provides a fascinating snapshot of Marie at 13 - sophisticated beyond her years yet still a child (as her mother's marginal note reminds us). The progression from January's social observations to May's intense romantic obsession shows her rapid emotional development. The comprehensive tagging ensures future translators can capture these nuances with full context.
