## Tagging Standards Applied

### Format Consistency
- All tags use format: `[//]: # ( [#Entity_Name](/src/_original/_glossary/Entity_Name.md) )`
- Tags placed above paragraphs where entities appear
- Multiple entities can be tagged in single lines
- Every entity mention now has appropriate hashtag link

### Coverage Completeness

- Maintains alphabetical organization with descriptions

### Workflow Enhancement
- Established systematic entity identification process
- Created standards for comprehensive tagging
- Documented importance of research preceding translation

## Impact for Translation Project

### Research Foundation Complete
Book 01 now provides comprehensive research foundation for translators:
- Every entity has accessible background information
- Cultural context is preserved and documented
- Social relationships and hierarchies are clear
- No ambiguous references remain unresolved

### Translation Readiness
- All entries ready for translation with full context
- Translators can access entity information immediately

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Create glossary entries for remaining frequent Book 00 entities
2. Begin comprehensive tagging of Book 02
3. Add cultural footnotes for theater, literature, and social customs

### Medium Priority
1. Complete Books 03-04 tagging
2. Process Book 05 from raw carnet
