## Critical Anomaly Discovered: August 18 Entry Split

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: The August 18, 1874 entry is abnormally split in the raw carnet file:

- **Part 1**: Lines 10084-10085 end abruptly with "Je pleure de rage en pensant à cela !!!!!!!"  
- **Part 2**: Lines 10086-10129 continue with "Je déjeune avec maman au Kursaal..."

This suggests either:
1. A page break in the original manuscript that wasn't properly handled during digitization
2. A scanning/OCR error that created an artificial break
3. An issue with the manuscript binding or preservation

**Action Taken**: 
- Updated 1874-08-18.md file with complete entry and detailed anomaly documentation
- Added clear warning in researcher comments for future investigation
- Full entry now spans paragraphs 04.1179-04.1201

**Recommendation**: This anomaly should be flagged for review by manuscript specialists to determine if other entries may have similar issues.

## Next Steps

Continue processing from August 19, 1874. The complete August 18 entry has been reconstructed.
