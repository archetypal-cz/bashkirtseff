## Entities Needing Glossary Entries
### From Book 02 August entries:
- Preiss (business contact)
- Francine (dressmaker)
- Warpahowsky (visitor) 
- Lise & Aggie (gift recipients)
- Spitzer (Vienna dressmaker)
- Gutman (theater box owner)

- Ferry (shoe shop)
- Mlle Augustine (Worth sales assistant)
- Sacha (tobacco incident)
- Lefèvre (wine merchant)
- Prater (Vienna park - may need entry)

## Next Steps
1. Continue adding taglinks to remaining Book 02 entries (August-December 1873)
2. Create missing glossary entries for identified entities
3. Add taglinks to remaining Book 00 entries
4. Verify all entries have appropriate hashtag links

## Pattern Established
- Taglinks format: `[//]: # ( [#Entity_Name](/src/_original/_glossary/Entity_Name.md) )`
- Place above paragraphs where entities first appear or play significant role
- Multiple entities can be on same comment line, separated by spaces
- Only add to ORIGINAL files, not translations
