## Key Events

### June 1 - The Berthe Encounter
This is one of the most significant entries in the diary. Marie meets Berthe Boyd (now Lady Paget) and they have an intense conversation about Hamilton:

**Hamilton Revelations:**
- Currently at Baden, looks "like a stick" 
- Goes to Egypt every winter
- Wife is UGLY, dark, tall, with "German shoulders"
- Wife not rich (English daughters never are)
- Marriage was a TRAP: drunk, tricked by Duchess of Manchester
- Income: 5 MILLION FLORINS yearly (Marie stunned)
- Supports mother, sister, Carlo (until Carlo married Paskevitch)
- Will come to Paris for GRAND PRIX

**Emotional Impact:**
- Both girls loved Hamilton, both know it, can't look at each other
- Marie: "we were one person in that moment"
- Physical reaction: can't breathe, shivers, hot then cold
- Oscillates between impossibility and necessity of being with him
