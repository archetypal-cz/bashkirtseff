   - "amabilissimamente" - creating superlatives
   - "mi sono levata sulla punta dei piedi"

2. **English** for modern concepts and society:
   - "mercenary," "fast," "fellows"
   - "contrived," "splendidly"
   - Direct quotes from admirers

3. **Latin** abbreviations: "viz." (videlicet), "ad alta voce"
