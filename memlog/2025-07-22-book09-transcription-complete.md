### Sample Annotation Quality
```markdown
[//]: # ( 2025-07-22T23:19:00 RSR: Final entries of Book 9, lines 11200-11291, show Marie's complete psychological collapse. The obsessive piano ritual - playing Litolff's fileuse 50 times for five hours to "earn" Larderei through superstition - demonstrates psychological deterioration. Her confession "je me tiens en horreur" leads to clinical analysis: "Aurais-je vraiment le cerveau détraqué?" The Dante reference about frost-killed flowers captures her psychological state. Book 9 ends with Marie's psychological nadir before recovery would begin in subsequent volumes. )
