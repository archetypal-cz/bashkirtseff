### Key Research Findings

#### Language Phenomena Documented:
1. **Multilingual Poetry**: Walitsky's Doria verses in French, English, German, Russian
2. **Code-Switching**: 
   - "He is of no consequence" (dismissing Merjeewsky)
   - "to speak fluently" (about Italian)
   - "it is all right!" (about noble lineage)
3. **Wordplay**: 
   - "Airam" (Marie reversed) - "Air et ode, et air et âme"
   - "Airod" (Doria reversed)
   - Gender joke calling man "cette dame"
4. **Nicknames**: 
   - "Mouchka Bashkirtseff" (little fly)
   - "coquillage marin" (marine shell) for Merjeewsky

#### Psychological Insights:
1. **Hamilton Obsession**: Prayer ability returns in London after marriage-induced spiritual crisis
2. **England Identity**: Profound sense of belonging - "je rentre chez moi"
3. **Health Crisis**: 15-year-old exhausted from months of 3-4am bedtimes
4. **Social Dynamics**: Complex power games with admirers, rivals, and family

#### Cultural References:
1. **Anglican Prayer Book**: Marie wants copy for daily reading
2. **Crystal Palace**: Ancient Rome statues trigger historical philosophy
3. **Odyssey**: Reading Mars/Venus/Vulcan scene on boat
4. **Louis XIV**: Triggers royal fantasies about dismissing people
