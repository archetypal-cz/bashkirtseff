## Task Assignments

As this is a collaborative project between human translators and AI assistants, tasks should be assigned based on strengths:

- **Human Translators**: Final translation decisions, cultural nuances, creative adaptations
- **AI Translator Mode**: Initial translation drafts, consistency checking, footnote suggestions
- **AI Editor Mode**: Proofreading, grammar checking, style consistency
- **AI Project Assistant**: Documentation, organization, progress tracking, summary creation
