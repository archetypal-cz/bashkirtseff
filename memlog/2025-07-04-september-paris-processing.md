## Work Completed - Book 04

### Daily Entries Created (September 17 - October 3, 1874)
- **Paris Period (Sept 17-30)**: 14 entries documenting Paris shopping and social life
- **Return to Nice (Oct 1-3)**: 3 entries showing family tensions and pavilion crisis

### Key Research Findings

#### Language Phenomena:
1. **Meta-commentary**: "Je pense qu'on peut beaucoup supprimer dans ce livre" - Marie considers future editing
2. **Multilingual elements**:
   - Fake Italian telegram: "Perche siete bianca sono untranquillo"
   - English phrases: "in a hurry", "by all means", "rubbish"
   - Fashion similes: "comme un train express"
3. **Superstitious rituals**: Water splashing based on city name letter count
4. **Self-description**: Detailed physical portrait on Sept 25, including missing incisors

#### Psychological Insights:
1. **Hamilton trauma anniversary**: Confesses marriage "shook" her a year ago
2. **Fashion philosophy**: Worth = nobility, Laferrière = gallantry
3. **Family manipulation**: Mother "poisons" all pleasures before granting them
4. **Pavilion crisis**: Extreme emotional breakdown over lost study space

#### Paris Shopping & Society:
1. **Fashion houses**: Worth triumph after previous "farce", Laferrière abandonment
2. **Interior decoration**: 50,000 francs for Duval furniture, shell-shaped bed design
3. **Horse shopping**: Extensive search, wants "doré" (golden) horse
4. **Social encounters**: Doria in Paris, Rémy Moreno disappointment, fake Doria gossip

#### Key Entities Documented:
- **Shops**: Worth, Laferrière, Duval, Virot, Baccarat, Maurice (horses)
- **People**: Doria brothers, Gonzalès family, Rémy Moreno, Rodionoff, Tchernichoff
- **Places**: Bois de Boulogne, Opéra-Comique, Champs-Élysées, restaurant russe

### Important Discoveries:
1. **Self-awareness**: "Malheureusement je ne suis que gentille, by all means"
2. **Fashion as armor**: Seeks clothes that "impose" despite simplicity
3. **Financial reality**: Constant money worries despite lavish spending
4. **Return trauma**: Nice seems "laide, déserte, petite" after London/Paris

### Next Session Priorities:
1. Continue processing October 1874 entries
2. Create glossary entries for Paris period entities
3. Tag September/October entries with hashtag links
4. Track Marie's pavilion crisis resolution
