## Translation Approach
- Following established workflow: Translate → Edit → Revise → Final Edit
- Preserving V0 (original translation) in comments for tracking changes
- Editor comments highlight specific improvements needed
- Focus on natural Czech that captures Marie's personality

## Key Editorial Improvements
- Replacing overly formal language with Marie's youthful spontaneity
- Using period-appropriate but accessible Czech (e.g., "kokotky" for courtesans)
- Adding explanatory footnotes where needed
- Improving word choices to capture emotional nuance
- Clarifying ironic or sarcastic statements

## Terminology Decisions
- "cocottes" → "kokotky" (more period-appropriate than "lehké ženy")
- "table d'hôte" → kept with footnote explanation
- Emotional terms strengthened (e.g., "ubožák" → "bídák" for "misérable")
