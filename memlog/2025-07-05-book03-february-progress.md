### Linguistic Observations

1. **Marie's Errors**: 
   - "j'exclame [sic]" - rare grammatical mistake
   - Shows she's still learning despite sophistication

2. **Italics Usage**:
   - *fatuité* (vanity)
   - *se vanter* (to boast)
   - *du bénéfice au profit de Samartseff*
   - *Au deuxième rang*

3. **Marginal Notes**:
   - "je nomme Woerman baron par dérision" - calls Woerman baron mockingly

4. **Self-Awareness**:
   - "(comme tu admires ce que tu fais, présomptueuse enfant !)"
   - Shows Marie's internal dialogue

## Key Themes
