### Key Translation Victories

1. **Multilingual Handling** (Feb 17):
   - Properly marked English phrase with ==highlight==
   - Added explanatory footnote: *V originále anglicky:*

2. **Critical Corrections** (Feb 18):
   - "To je ale hlava" → "To jsem ale blázen" (Marie criticizing herself)
   - "Boreel poblázněný" → "do mě blázen" (infatuated WITH her)
   - "rychle se vrátila" → "brzy se vrátila" (soon vs. hurriedly)

3. **Natural Language Flow** (Feb 19):
   - "odpálkovala" perfectly captured slang "fiché"
   - Escalation from "mrzí" to "trápí" for emotional intensity

4. **Voice Preservation** (Feb 20):
   - Marie's class consciousness maintained
   - Complex emotional hierarchy preserved

5. **Dramatic Intensity** (Feb 21):
   - "prokleté město" for cursed Hamilton location
