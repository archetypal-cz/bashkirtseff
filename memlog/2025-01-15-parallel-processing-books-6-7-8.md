## Workflow Efficiency

The parallel processing approach is working well:
1. Books cover different time periods, so no date conflicts
2. Separate directory structures allow independent processing
3. Each book has different characters and contexts, providing variety
4. Raw carnet files are manageable sizes (11k-12k lines each)

## Quality Observations

- All entries properly formatted with researcher comments
- Source line numbers documented for continuity
- French text preserved exactly as transcribed
- Proper markdown structure maintained
- Date formats consistent across books

## Next Session Goals

1. **Book 6**: Complete October batch (Oct 28-31, 1875)
2. **Book 7**: Process January 26-30, 1876 batch  
3. **Book 8**: Extract May 12-15, 1876 entries
4. Aim for ~15-20 total entries per session across all books
