# Linguistic Analysis - August 20-25, 1874

## Date: 2025-07-04
## Role: Researcher
## Task: Document Marie's linguistic irregularities and multilingual abilities

### Summary
Added RSR comments to August 20-25 entries documenting Marie's linguistic creativity, code-switching, and language play.

### Key Linguistic Findings

1. **Invented Words/Phrases**
   - "Plobster" - Marie's invented classification for certain types of men (possibly blend of "plodder" + "lobster")
   - "Tam-tam-tam" - playful nickname for Tamancheff family
   - "petit chien" - self-deprecating metaphor (puppy vs. mature woman)

2. **Spelling Uncertainties**
   - "estacade" (pier) - explicitly notes uncertainty: "je ne sais comment écrire ce mot"

3. **Code-Switching**
   - Italian: "Brutto" after French "C'est laid" - reinforcing emotions
   - Italian: "tenerissimi" for tender farewells
   - English: "she is very wild" - quoting Scottish girl about Duchess
   - English: "His Grace the Duke of Hamilton" - written in darkness

4. **Foreign Food Terms**
   - "varenikis" (Russian dumplings) with French translation "sorte de chaussons"

5. **Metaphorical Usage**
   - "un pope" - using Russian Orthodox priest term for formal/proper Basilewsky

6. **Linguistic Mockery**
   - Baron Leiss's broken French: "Tiens, tiens si' plaît [sic]?"

### Patterns Observed
- Marie switches languages to intensify emotions (Italian for strong feelings)
- Uses English when thinking of British aristocracy
- Provides translations for Russian terms showing bilingual consciousness
- Creates playful nicknames and classifications
- Shows metalinguistic awareness by commenting on her own spelling

### Next Steps
- Continue tracking linguistic patterns in subsequent entries
- Note any evolution in her language play as she matures
- Document instances where she explicitly mentions language learning or difficulties
