- Total: 11 daily entries created

### Key Observations

#### March 29-31, 1874
- March 29: Another hostile poem about "Fedus" (Lambertye). Marie complains seriously to her mother about his staring. Nearly faints from heat after horse riding.
- March 30: Monaco trip - family too absorbed in gambling to supervise properly. Evening concert where Lambertye appears with Duchess de Mouchy. Disgusted by men with cocottes on the train back.
- March 31: Profound reflection on Hamilton: "To love him now is a sin" yet "he is the only one I could kiss... with pleasure." Discovers wonderful echo from her window at night.

#### April 1-9, 1874
- April 1: April Fool's prank on Walitsky (fake letter from Englishman he slapped). Karitoffs propose match with Sorokooumovski heir (400,000 roubles/year).
- April 2: Night poem praising frogs' singing. News of someone's suicide over marriage/property loss. Disgusted by common furniture at villa 55.
- April 3: Terror finding journal missing from behind painting. Family recites comic verses. Possible earthquake - beds shaking.
- April 4: **Missing in raw text**
- April 5: Mystical vision while praying: Hamilton and Wittgenstein emerge from her breast, fight; Hamilton turns Wittgenstein into white dog, then dog becomes herself.
- April 6: Wittgenstein on tiny horse/mule with feet almost touching ground. Auguste mentions he rode a donkey 3 years ago. Marie declares she adores him for the extravagance.
- April 7: Extended nature philosophy. Wittgenstein is "the only man in Nice" but Hamilton remains divine. Spring evening intoxicates her.
- April 8: Dreams of Wittgenstein. Church fasting begins. Sees Wittgenstein with two women, head down "like pigs." Bibliomancy with Macaulay yields "liberty and progress."
- April 9: Breaks lock on diary box. Church communion service. Lambertye has left Nice - "what a misfortune!"

2. **Hamilton worship continues**: Comparing all men unfavorably to the married duke
3. **Wittgenstein fascination**: His eccentricity (riding tiny horses/donkeys) captivates her
4. **Spring awakening**: Philosophical reflections on nature, seasons, and her place between society and nature
5. **Family tensions**: Gambling obsession, lack of supervision, mother's illness
