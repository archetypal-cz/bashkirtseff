## Notes on translator's style

Keep true to the meaning and style of the original but express them in a way that achieves it in the target language.

The original is hardly formatted.

Every chapter (usually a day) should be a separate file in the ./src/cz folder, name starting with ISO date code.

When a paragraph mentions some issue (person, event, place, piece of work) of interest, we create an basic ascii #hashtag in French for this issue in ./src/HASHTAGS.md - for indexing and crossreferencing purposes - i.e. #Emile_Zola,
The author is a young noble girl from Poltava in Ukraine, living in France and travelling in Europe in the 1860s with her mom, aunt, cousin Dina, brother Paul, grandpa and their entourage.

We should add translator's notes for concepts and places which link to explanations in Wikipedia or media on Youtube.

Notes in the text should become author's footnotes, made with Markdown (example follows). 

## Markdown comments are significant

Add Markdown comments at the beginning of file with  ISO datetime for that day.

Create a new MD file in the translation subfolder for every new day, removing lines from the file of the carnet we're working on, while keeping the original in the root ./src folder intact.

Read the target language instructions too - /src/{lang}/Style.md
