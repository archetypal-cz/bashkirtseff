# Hashtags

What follows is a list of french-named hashtags for events, people, places, works etc. with a short English explanation of what it is on the next line (indented to match the list item). When we're looking around for what to do and encounter an obvious hashtag without explanation, let's provide one or expand on it. 

We should also write down comma-separated ISO dates of diary entries where this topic gets mentioned - as the next line of this list item.

Hashtags must ONLY contain western ASCII characters, and are not to be case sensitive.

Translations will the be able to take this file and use it to create an index/dictionary/cross-reference material.
