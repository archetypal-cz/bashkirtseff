# Research Notes: Marie Bashkirtseff's Diary (August 11-19, 1873)

## Historical Context

### Vienna World Exhibition of 1873

[//]: # ( 2025-04-05T13:28:50 RSR: The Vienna World Exhibition of 1873 was a significant event that Marie Bashkirtseff visited during her stay in Vienna. )

The Vienna World Exhibition was held from May 1 to November 2, 1873, in the Austro-Hungarian capital. It was designed to showcase industrial, cultural, and scientific achievements from around the world and coincided with Emperor Franz Joseph I's 25th anniversary as ruler. The exhibition aimed to elevate Austria-Hungary's status among major European powers like France and Britain.

Marie mentions visiting the "Exposition" several times in her diary entries from August 11-15, 1873. On August 13, she specifically mentions visiting the "Agrikulturhalle" (Agricultural Hall) where she found her father's tobacco on display. She also mentions seeing Lefèvre's wine.

The exhibition faced significant challenges, including the stock market crash of May 1873 (part of the global "Panic of 1873") and a concurrent cholera epidemic, which severely impacted attendance. This may explain Marie's mention of her aunt's fear of cholera when Marie became ill on August 14.

The centerpiece of the fair was the Rotunda, the world's largest domed building at the time, surrounded by themed halls including the Palace of Industry and the Hall of Engines. National exhibits showcased both technological innovation and traditional arts, emphasizing cultural pride.

Paris in 1873 was in a period of recovery and transformation following the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune uprising (1871). The Third Republic had been established, and the city was regaining its position as a center of culture, fashion, and society.
