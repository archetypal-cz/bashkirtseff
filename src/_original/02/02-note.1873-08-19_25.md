# Historical Context: Marie Bashkirtseff's Paris Visit (August 19-25, 1873)

## Fashion and Shopping in 1870s Paris

Marie's diary entries from August 19-25, 1873, provide a detailed account of her shopping experiences in Paris, offering valuable insights into the fashion industry and consumer culture of the period.

### Haute Couture Houses

1. **House of Worth**: Founded by Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895) in 1858, this was the premier fashion house in Paris by the 1870s. Located at 7 Rue de la Paix, Worth essentially created the concept of haute couture and dressed royalty and aristocracy across Europe. Marie's fascination with Worth reflects his status as the most prestigious designer of the era. The prices she mentions (700-1900 francs for dresses) were indeed substantial sums, equivalent to approximately $3,500-9,500 in today's currency.

2. **Maison Laferrière**: Founded by Madeleine Laferrière in 1869 and located at 28 rue Taitbout, this fashion house quickly established itself alongside Worth as a symbol of haute couture excellence. While Marie seems less impressed with Laferrière's creations, the house was known for luxurious designs featuring intricate craftsmanship, lavish fabrics, and detailed embroidery.

### Milliners and Accessories

1. **Caroline Reboux**: A prominent Parisian milliner whose boutique at 23 Rue de la Paix was established in 1865. By the 1870s, Reboux had become one of the most influential milliners in Paris, with clients including Empress Eugénie. Her designs were known for their simplicity and elegance.

2. **Mantel**: Another high-end milliner recommended by Worth himself, suggesting its quality and status. Marie's mention of a "chapeau Rubens" refers to a style inspired by the wide-brimmed, plumed hats often depicted in portraits by the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens.

3. **Jouvin**: A renowned glove maker, with gloves being an essential accessory for fashionable women of the era.

4. **Ferry**: Likely a bootmaker specializing in the fashionable button boots that were popular during this period.

### Department Stores

**Le Bon Marché**: Founded in 1838 as a small haberdashery, it underwent significant expansion in the early 1870s under the ownership of Aristide and Marguerite Boucicaut. By 1873, it featured 22 departments across multiple floors with wide, open interiors designed with the help of Gustave Eiffel's engineering firm. Marie's dismissal of her cousin Dina's suggestion to visit Le Bon Marché as reflecting "vulgaire" tastes suggests that Marie, with her aristocratic aspirations, considered the department store beneath her social standing, despite its popularity among the Parisian middle class.

**Aux Trois Quartiers**: Established in 1829 on Boulevard de la Madeleine, this was another of Paris's early department stores. By the 1870s, it had become a notable shopping destination for the Parisian elite and middle class, offering a wide variety of products organized into separate departments.

## Leisure and Entertainment in 1870s Paris

### Horse Racing

Horse racing was a fashionable pastime among the upper classes in Paris during this period. Marie's diary entries reveal her enthusiasm for the sport and provide insights into the racing culture of the time.

1. **Longchamp Racecourse**: Established in 1857 in the Bois de Boulogne, this was the premier venue for horse racing in Paris. The racecourse had suffered damage during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) but had recovered by 1873. Marie mentions that the races they attended were "simple races" and "not the races of May or October at Longchamp," referring to the more prestigious racing events held at specific times of the year.

2. **Le Derby**: Likely a publication focused on horse racing that Marie subscribed to for 28 francs per year, though specific information about this publication from the 1870s is limited.

### Parks and Public Spaces

1. **Bois de Boulogne**: A large public park on the western edge of Paris, created under Napoleon III in the 1850s. The park had suffered significant damage during the Franco-Prussian War and the Siege of Paris (1870-71), when trees were cut for firewood and animals hunted for food. By 1873, when Marie visited, the park was recovering and regaining its status as a social hub for the Parisian elite.

2. **Jardin d'Acclimatation**: A zoological garden located within the Bois de Boulogne, opened in 1860 that showcased exotic plants and animals. It had reopened in 1872 after suffering during the Siege of Paris.

3. **Trocadéro**: An area that would soon undergo significant transformation - in 1876, construction would begin on the Palais du Trocadéro for the 1878 World's Fair.

### Opera and Theater

1. **Opéra-Comique**: A famous opera house in Paris, founded in 1714. In 1873, it was located at its second Salle Favart building on Place Boieldieu. Marie attended a performance of "Zampa," an opera by Ferdinand Hérold that premiered in 1831 and remained popular throughout the 19th century.

2. **Folies Dramatiques**: A theater where Marie saw "La fille de Madame Angot," a comic opera by Charles Lecocq that was extremely popular in Paris at the time.

## Key People in Marie's Diary

### The Duke of Hamilton

William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845-1895), was a Scottish nobleman who features prominently in Marie's diary as the object of her infatuation. In 1873, he was 28 years old and would marry Lady Mary Montagu later that year. The Duke was known for his extravagant lifestyle and passion for horse racing, though his financial difficulties were significant despite inheriting vast estates. His horse Cortolvin had won the Grand National Steeplechase in 1867, but by 1873, his racing fortunes had apparently declined, as Marie mentions he is "reduced to a single horse instead of five" and "for three years he has fallen in the races, arriving only third."

Marie's information about the Duke's family connections is accurate. His mother, Princess Marie Amelie of Baden, was indeed the sister of the Grand Duke of Baden, who was married to the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm I of Prussia ("Guillaume" in Marie's text). This made the Duke of Hamilton a nephew by marriage to the Prussian royal family, not related to Napoleon III as her aunt incorrectly claimed.

### Gioia

The identity of "Gioia," whose portrait so captivates Marie, remains somewhat mysterious. Based on the context, she appears to have been a beautiful woman connected to the Duke of Hamilton, possibly a mistress or romantic interest. Marie's intense reaction to seeing Gioia's portrait - her feelings of jealousy, inadequacy, and the shattering of her hopes regarding the Duke - provides a poignant glimpse into her emotional state and self-image. The fact that Marie, her aunt, Paul, and Dina all recognize Gioia from her portrait suggests she was a known figure in their social circles, though specific historical records about her are limited.

### The Boyd Family

Marie mentions encountering members of the Boyd family several times during her stay in Paris. They appear to be acquaintances from Nice, with particular mention of Berthe and Blanche Boyd. These encounters highlight the interconnected nature of the European elite social circles that Marie moved in, where the same families might be encountered in different fashionable locations across Europe.

## Marie's Financial Situation and Social Aspirations

Marie's detailed accounting of her expenses provides valuable insight into the cost of fashionable living in Paris in the 1870s. Her annual allowance of 2,500 francs (approximately $12,500-15,000 in today's currency) was substantial but clearly insufficient for the lifestyle she aspired to. The prices she mentions for various items demonstrate the high cost of luxury goods in Paris:

- 700 francs for a dress from Worth
- 1,900 francs for her aunt's dress from Worth
- 300 francs for a costume from Laferrière
- 115 francs for a hat from Mantel
- 85 francs for a felt hat from Reboux
- 100 francs for a Rubens-style hat
- 100 francs for a rain coat

Marie's comment about needing at least 3,500 francs annually and still considering that "modest" reflects both the expensive nature of high fashion and her own ambitious social aspirations. Her determination to establish herself in Parisian society through the right clothing, accessories, and social connections reveals the importance of appearance and material display in the social world she inhabited and aspired to conquer.
