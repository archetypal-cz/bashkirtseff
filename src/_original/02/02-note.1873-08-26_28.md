# Historical Context: Marie Bashkirtseff's Return Journey from Paris to Nice (August 26-28, 1873)

## Photography in 1870s Paris: Walery Studio

Marie's visit to the Walery photography studio on August 26, 1873, provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of high-end portrait photography in Paris during the early 1870s.

### Stanisław Julian Ostroróg (Walery)

The photographer "Walery" mentioned by Marie was Count Stanisław Julian Ostroróg (1830-1890), a Polish nobleman who fled to France after participating in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He established a photography studio in Paris under the name "Walery" (derived from his wife's name, Waleria). His studio at 9 Rue de Londres, which Marie visited, had been established around 1871-1872, making it relatively new but already fashionable when Marie visited in 1873.

The Walery studio quickly gained fame for its portraits of celebrities, aristocrats, and beautiful women of the era. The studio specialized in theatrical photography and portraits of opera singers, actresses, and other performers, which explains why Marie saw portraits of Gioia there. By 1873, the studio was becoming one of the most fashionable photography establishments in Paris, attracting clients from high society.

Walery's portraits were characterized by their dramatic lighting, elegant poses, and attention to detail. The photographs were often distributed as cabinet cards and cartes de visite, which were popular collectibles among the upper classes. Marie's desire to have her portrait taken there reflects both the studio's growing reputation and her own social aspirations.

The Walery studio later opened branches in London and Nice, further cementing its reputation as a premier photography establishment. After Stanisław Julian Ostroróg's death in 1890, his son, Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg (1863-1929), continued using the Walery name and became known for photographing theater and cabaret stars.

## Fashion Houses and Shopping in 1870s Paris

Marie's diary entries from August 26-27, 1873, continue to document her experiences with Parisian fashion houses, providing valuable insights into the haute couture industry of the period.

### House of Worth

Founded by Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895) in Paris in 1858, the House of Worth was at the height of its influence and prestige in 1873. Located at 7 Rue de la Paix, Worth had essentially created the concept of haute couture and established the fashion designer as we understand it today.

By 1873, Worth's designs featured elaborate bustle silhouettes that had replaced the earlier crinoline styles. His creations were characterized by rich fabrics such as silk, velvet, and satin, often incorporating multiple fabrics in a single garment with elaborate trimmings including lace, beading, and embroidery.

Worth pioneered the use of live models to present seasonal designs to clients, who would select designs to be custom-tailored to their measurements. His clientele included European royalty, American millionaires, and prominent figures from around the world.

Marie's preference for her Worth dress over the Laferrière creation reflects Worth's superior status in the fashion hierarchy of the time. Her morning visit to Worth on August 27 to order a dress before her departure demonstrates the importance she placed on acquiring garments from this prestigious establishment.

### Maison Laferrière

Established in 1869 at 28 rue Taitbout in Paris by Madeleine Laferrière, this fashion house had quickly established itself as one of the premier couture houses in Paris by 1873. The house was known for creating elegant, high-quality garments featuring luxurious fabrics, intricate details, and sophisticated silhouettes.

Marie's frustration with her dress from Laferrière reflects the high expectations she had for garments from such a prestigious establishment. Her repeated fittings and adjustments, followed by her ultimate rejection of the dress as "atroce" (atrocious), demonstrates both her exacting standards and the importance of proper fit and appearance in the world of 1870s high fashion.

### Mantel

Mentioned as a milliner where Marie ordered a "chapeau Rubens" (Rubens hat), Mantel appears to have been another high-end fashion establishment in Paris. The Rubens hat style was inspired by the wide-brimmed, plumed hats often depicted in portraits by the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640).

### Ferry

Identified as a bootmaker where Marie's aunt purchased boots and Marie acquired a pair with "barrettes" (straps or bars), likely referring to the fashionable button boots or bar-strap shoes that were popular during this period.

## Travel in 1870s France

Marie's journey from Paris to Nice follows a common route for travelers in the 19th century. After departing Paris by train, she travels south through France, stopping at Mâcon, Marseille, and Toulon before reaching Nice.

### Railway Travel

The Paris-Lyon-Mediterranean Railway (PLM) company operated the main line connecting Paris to the Mediterranean coast, which had been completed in stages during the mid-19th century. The journey would have taken approximately 24 hours in total, with Marie and her companions traveling overnight and arriving in Marseille in the morning.

Train travel in the 1870s was divided into classes, with first-class offering the most comfortable accommodations. Given Marie's social status and expectations, she and her family would likely have traveled first-class, which provided upholstered seats, more space, and better amenities than second or third-class carriages.

The thunderstorm Marie describes during the journey between Paris and Mâcon would have been particularly dramatic when viewed from a train, with the lightning illuminating the countryside as they traveled through the night.

### Marseille and Toulon

These Mediterranean port cities were important stops on the journey to Nice. Marseille, as France's principal Mediterranean port, was a bustling commercial center. Toulon served as a major naval base and port city. Marie's brief stops in these cities were typical for travelers making their way along the Mediterranean coast.

## Literary References

### Alexandre Dumas's "Impressions de voyage en Russie"

Marie mentions reading "Impression de voyage en Russie" by Dumas during her train journey. This refers to "En Russie" (In Russia), a travel memoir by Alexandre Dumas père (1802-1870), published in 1865. Dumas visited Russia in 1858-1859 and wrote about his experiences and observations, including historical accounts of figures like Peter the Great.

Marie's criticism of Dumas's portrayal of Peter the Great as a "demi-dieu" (demigod) reflects her Russian background and presumably more nuanced understanding of Russian history. Her comment about having been "in love" with Peter the Great suggests her admiration for historical figures and perhaps her romantic imagination.

The mention of "Lady Hamilton, princesse de Bade" in Dumas's book triggers Marie's fixation on the Hamilton name, connecting to her infatuation with the Duke of Hamilton. This demonstrates how her personal obsessions color her reading and interpretation of unrelated texts.

## Marie's Emotional State

### Infatuation with the Duke of Hamilton

Marie's reference to "le misérable" (the miserable one) is almost certainly about the Duke of Hamilton, who has been the object of her infatuation throughout her diary. William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845-1895), was a Scottish nobleman who would marry Lady Mary Montagu later in 1873.

Marie's intense emotional reaction to not seeing him during her Paris visit, and her dramatic statement that she would go to China just to see him pass by, reveals the depth of her infatuation. Her contemplation of how she would feel if he were dead or married demonstrates her tendency toward melodramatic imagination and emotional extremes.

### Fixation on Gioia

Marie's continued obsession with Gioia, whose portrait she had seen the previous day, is evident in her behavior at the Walery studio. Her repeated viewing of Gioia's photographs and comparison of herself to this beautiful woman reveals her insecurities about her own appearance and attractiveness.

Marie's comments about Gioia's beauty and her own potential future beauty ("dans dix ans elle sera vieille, dans dix ans je serai grande") reflect both her jealousy and her hope that time will improve her own situation while diminishing Gioia's advantages.

### Attitude Toward Nice

Marie's statement that "Tous les endroits sont égaux pour moi excepté Paris que j'adore et Nice que j'abhorre" (All places are equal to me except Paris, which I adore, and Nice, which I abhor) reveals her strong preference for the cultural and social opportunities of Paris over the provincial atmosphere of Nice. Her complaint about the heat and the lack of opportunity to study in Nice suggests her frustration with returning to what she perceived as a limiting environment after experiencing the excitement and possibilities of Paris.

This contrast between Paris and Nice would continue to be a theme in Marie's diary, reflecting her ambitions for a more cosmopolitan life and her desire to establish herself in the artistic and social circles of Paris rather than remaining in the relative isolation of Nice.
