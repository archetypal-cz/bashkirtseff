## Content Overview

These entries continue Marie's September 1873 diary, covering:

- Marie's philosophical reflections on marriage and relationships

## Research Notes

1. **Marie's Educational Ambitions**: The September 15 entry reveals Marie's pride in her language abilities (Russian, French, English, Italian) and her studies of German and Latin. Her excitement about speaking Italian for the first time and having her first physics lesson demonstrates her intellectual ambitions, which were unusual for young women of her time.

2. **Complex Views on Marriage**: The September 18 entry contains Marie's most explicit statements about her unconventional views on marriage. She doesn't expect Hamilton to "live like good husbands" but merely wants "to take Gioia's place with the title of his wife," stating she would be content with "one hour per day" of his attention. Her statement "Non tout en étant sa femme, je veux être sa maîtresse" (No, while being his wife, I want to be his mistress) reveals her understanding that wives and mistresses traditionally occupied different roles in aristocratic marriages.

3. **Physical Symptoms of Infatuation**: Marie provides a detailed account of her physical reactions to thoughts of Hamilton - stopping whatever she's doing, labored breathing, voice cutting out, shivering, foot-tapping "like an impatient horse" - vividly portraying the intensity of her feelings.

4. **Rivalry with Gioia**: The September 19 entry contains Marie's most detailed description of Gioia, focusing critically on her "fake" hair and face "painted white." Her rhetorical question "comment fait-on pour l'embrasser, puisqu'elle a comme un masque?" (how does one kiss her, since she has like a mask?) reveals her preoccupation with Gioia's relationship with Hamilton.

5. **Self-Awareness**: Throughout these entries, Marie shows remarkable self-awareness, acknowledging the "impossibility" of her desires while still maintaining them. Her ability to analyze her own feelings and recognize how others might view her infatuation shows a level of maturity that contrasts with her sometimes childish behavior.
