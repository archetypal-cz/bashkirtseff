# Hashtags Update Note

Date: 2025-04-05

## New Glossary Entries Created

I've created the following new glossary entries based on people and concepts mentioned in the September 15-19, 1873 diary entries:

1. **Bensa** - Marie's teacher who arranged for other professors and was often teased by Marie and Dina
2. **Hitchcock** - Marie's English conversation teacher
3. **Michelezzi** - Marie's Italian teacher who was delighted when she spoke Italian for the first time
4. **Soubise** - A woman who accompanied Gioia (the Duke of Hamilton's mistress)
5. **Mouton** - A stable owner or horse dealer from whom Marie rented horses
6. **Said** - A servant for whom Marie ordered a livery (uniform)
7. **Ferry** - A bootmaker or shoe merchant whose boots Marie described as "charming"

## Recommended HASHTAGS.md Updates

The following hashtags should be added to the HASHTAGS.md file:

```markdown
- [#Bensa](/_original/_glossary/Bensa.md)
- [#Ferry](/_original/_glossary/Ferry.md)
- [#Hitchcock](/_original/_glossary/Hitchcock.md)
- [#Michelezzi](/_original/_glossary/Michelezzi.md)
- [#Mouton](/_original/_glossary/Mouton.md)
- [#Said](/_original/_glossary/Said.md)
- [#Soubise](/_original/_glossary/Soubise.md)
```

These should be inserted in alphabetical order in the existing list.

## Next Steps

1. Update HASHTAGS.md with these new entries (to be done by Project Assistant)
2. Consider adding references to these people in the September 1873 monthly summary
3. Add hashtag references in the relevant diary entries when they are mentioned
