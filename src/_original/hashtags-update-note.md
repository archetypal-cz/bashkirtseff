# Hashtags Update Note

## Updates Needed

Based on my research of the diary entries, the following hashtags need to be added to the src/HASHTAGS.md file:

1. **#Boreel** - A glossary entry has been created at src/_original/_glossary/Boreel.md

The hashtag should be added to the alphabetical list in HASHTAGS.md with the following format:

```
- [#Boreel](/_original/_glossary/Boreel.md)
```

This should be placed in alphabetical order in the list.

## Additional Notes

During my review of Book 1 (January-February 1873), I found that several hashtags listed in HASHTAGS.md were missing their corresponding glossary entries. I've created the following glossary entries:

1. #Document_Humain - Created glossary entry at src/_original/_glossary/Document_Humain.md
2. #Russia - Created glossary entry at src/_original/_glossary/Russia.md

I've also updated the Mouton glossary entry to include the January 11, 1873 reference where Marie calls him "la canaille Mouton" and mentions that he didn't send her a horse.
