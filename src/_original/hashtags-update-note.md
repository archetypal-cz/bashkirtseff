# Hashtags Update Note

The following new glossary entries have been created based on the September 1873 diary entries:

1. [#French_Theater_Nice](/_original/_glossary/French_Theater_Nice.md) - The French Theater in Nice, which Marie attended on September 13, 1873
2. [#Le_ravin](/_original/_glossary/Le_ravin.md) - The Russian novel (likely "The Precipice" by Ivan Goncharov) that Marie reads in September 1873
3. [#Monte_Carlo](/_original/_glossary/Monte_Carlo.md) - The gambling resort in Monaco that Marie and her family visit several times

These entries should be added to the src/HASHTAGS.md file in alphabetical order.
