The reason for the trip—supervising furniture packing—suggests the family is consolidating their belongings, possibly preparing for a move or reorganization of their living arrangements. This departure leaves Marie with unprecedented independence in Paris, allowing her to focus entirely on her artistic work without family distractions or supervision. The timing at the beginning of 1879 marks a new phase in her development as an independent artist.)
