# February 1873 - Monthly Summary

## Overview
February 1873 marks the beginning of Marie Bashkirtseff's second notebook (Carnet N° 2).

Marie's diary is dominated by her romantic interests, primarily:

1. **The Duke of Hamilton** - Marie's primary obsession, whom she rarely sees but intensely admires from afar. She considers him the perfect match due to his title, wealth, and aristocratic status. She is jealous of his relationship with a woman named Gioia.

2. **Alfred Boreel** - A handsome young man Marie sees frequently on the promenade. Her feelings for him fluctuate throughout the month, sometimes claiming to love him, other times dismissing him as merely a distraction. She is disappointed to learn he is not a baron as she initially believed.
