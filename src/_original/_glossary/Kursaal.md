## Definition

The Kursaal (from German: Kur = cure/treatment + Saal = hall) was the central social and entertainment venue at European spa resorts and seaside towns during the 19th century. In Marie Bashkirtseff's diary, the Kursaal appears primarily in her accounts of Ostende (August 1874).

## The Ostende Kursaal

### Architecture and Location
The Ostende Kursaal, built in 1851-1852, was positioned strategically between the beach and the town. Marie notes that her apartment at rue Longue 104 was "in the middle of the path between the Kursaal and the casino," indicating its central location in the resort's geography.

   - Marie took refuge here during bad weather
   - Location for introductions and conversations
   - Where the Comte de Mulinare would pose and "turn his gracious back"

3. **Dining Facilities**:

   - The dining area on the digue (boardwalk) had views of the ocean

4. **Social Hub**:

   - Center for observing and being observed

## Social Significance

The Kursaal represented:
- **Cosmopolitan Culture**: International elite gathered here

## Historical Context

Kursaals were essential features of 19th-century resort architecture, representing the commercialization and democratization of leisure. They provided structured entertainment for the growing numbers of wealthy tourists seeking health cures and social diversion at seaside and spa resorts.

The Ostende Kursaal, in particular, was known for attracting an international clientele and maintaining high cultural standards, making it a perfect venue for Marie's social ambitions and observations.
