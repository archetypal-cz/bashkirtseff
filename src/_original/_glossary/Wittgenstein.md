## Overview

Wittgenstein appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a member of the aristocratic society in Nice during 1873. The family owned a villa in Nice and was part of the international high society that wintered on the French Riviera.

## Key Appearances

### October 15, 1873
During Marie's emotional crisis following news of Hamilton's engagement, she notes: "Point de Gioia... Point de Wittgenstein; partis!" (No Gioia... No Wittgenstein; gone!). This suggests Wittgenstein left Nice around the same time as Gioia, possibly indicating they were connected or traveled in the same social circles.

### Social Position

The Wittgenstein mentioned is likely a member of the prominent European noble family. The Wittgensteins were:
- **Austrian or German nobility**: The family had branches in both empires
- **Wealthy industrialists**: Known for their business enterprises
- **Cultural patrons**: Supported arts and music
- **International society**: Maintained residences in multiple European cities

## Connection to Nice Society

The Wittgensteins in Nice:
- Owned a villa (referenced as staying at their property)
- Part of the international winter colony
- Connected to other prominent figures like Gioia
- Their departure marked a change in the social season

## Relationship to Marie's Circle

- **Social peer**: Part of the same aristocratic circles
- **Gioia connection**: Their simultaneous departure suggests association
- **Hamilton orbit**: As part of Nice high society, likely knew the Duke

## Historical Context

Nice in the 1870s was a favorite wintering spot for European aristocracy. Families like the Wittgensteins would:
- Spend winters in Nice for the climate
- Maintain villas or rent prestigious properties
- Participate in the social season
- Form an international community of nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie

## Possible Identity

This could be a member of the prominent Wittgenstein family that later produced the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (born 1889). The family was already established in high society by the 1870s through their industrial wealth and cultural connections.

## Questions for Further Research
