# Egor Stepanovitch

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-01
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1873-05-03

A man who arrives unexpectedly at the Bashkirtseff home on May 3, 1873. Marie is surprised but very happy to see him, and describes him as "Pauvre homme ! voilà encore une vie brisée !" (Poor man! there's another broken life!).

The use of patronymic (Stepanovitch = son of Stepan) indicates he is Russian. His unexpected arrival and Marie's comment about his "broken life" suggest he may be fleeing some personal crisis or tragedy.

Marie's warm reception suggests he is a family friend or possibly a relative.
