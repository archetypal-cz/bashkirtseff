The Zamiatine family were legal adversaries of Marie's mother in a lawsuit in Russia in 1880. Marie refers to them with evident hostility.

In October 1880, Marie learns that her mother cannot leave Russia because she is bound as guarantor for 200,000 rubles in the lawsuit. The Zamiatines had succeeded in having this legal constraint imposed, which Marie describes as "a good trick indeed and they must be delighted."

Marie's comment reveals the Zamiatines actively sought to trap her mother legally - either preventing her from leaving Russia or forcing M. Bashkirtseff to pay a large sum if she did leave before the case was resolved.

The nature of the lawsuit and the Zamiatines' relationship to the family is not fully explained in this entry, but Marie's tone suggests they were seen as malicious opponents taking advantage of legal mechanisms to harass the family.

The name Zamiatine is Russian (Замятин/Замятина), indicating they were likely Russian nobility or landowners involved in property or inheritance disputes - common sources of protracted lawsuits in Imperial Russia.
