Dr. Pierre-Charles Potain (1825-1901) was one of the most celebrated French physicians of the late 19th century, known particularly for his expertise in cardiology and pulmonology. Marie refers to him as "the celebrated, the great" Dr. Potain.

In October 1880, Marie and her aunt had an appointment with Dr. Potain at 3 p.m., accompanied by M. de Miranda. By this time, Marie was deeply discouraged about her health, no longer believing she could be cured. She was trying to hide her increasing deafness from friends, though her aunt had noticed and Marie claimed to have had an ear problem that left it blocked.

**Historical significance:**
Potain was a pioneering cardiologist who:
- Developed the Potain sphygmomanometer for measuring blood pressure
- Made important contributions to understanding heart and lung diseases
- Was professor of clinical medicine at the Hôpital de la Charité in Paris
- Became a member of the Académie de Médecine

That Marie consulted "the great Potain" indicates both the seriousness of her condition and her family's ability to access the most eminent medical specialists in Paris.
