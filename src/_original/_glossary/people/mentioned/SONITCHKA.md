A friend of Marie's, involved in the famous "flower incident" during the Nice Carnival of February 23, 1873.

## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 23, 1873**: During the carnival parade, Marie stopped her carriage to speak with Sonitchka. While throwing flowers to her friend and calling out "Sophie Grigorievna," Marie accidentally threw the bouquets too close to Boreel, who was nearby. This incident mortified Marie, as she worried Boreel would think the flowers were meant for him rather than for Sonitchka.

## Name Analysis

"Sonitchka" is a Russian diminutive/affectionate form of Sofia/Sophie. The patronymic "Grigorievna" (daughter of Grigory/Gregory) confirms her Russian identity. Marie's use of the full formal name during the carnival suggests she was calling out to get her friend's attention in a crowded, noisy environment.

## Significance

This person was clearly a close enough friend that Marie felt comfortable stopping her carriage during the carnival procession to speak with her. The flower-throwing incident became one of those moments that Marie recalled with embarrassment for years afterward, as evidenced by her later marginal notes.
