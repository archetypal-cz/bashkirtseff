**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1874-01-01

## Overview

Makaroff (sometimes spelled Makarof in different sources) was one of Marie Bashkirtseff's teachers during her stay in Nice in 1873. He appears to have been a Russian expatriate who provided private lessons to children of Russian noble families.

## Role as Teacher

From Marie's diary entries:
- **Subject**: The specific subject he taught is not clearly stated in the early entries
- **Teaching Quality**: Marie describes him as "excellent professeur" despite finding him personally ridiculous
- **Schedule**: Regular lessons were part of Marie's educational routine

## Personality and Character

Marie's assessments of Makaroff are notably contradictory:
- **As a Teacher**: "excellent professeur" (excellent teacher)
- **As a Person**: "Il est si bête et drôle" (He is so stupid and funny)
- **Social Behavior**: "Il est vraiment maniéré" (He is really affected/mannered)

## Notable Incidents

### The Apology Incident (September 1, 1873)
One of the most detailed accounts involves a social conflict:
- Makaroff spoke too loudly and assertively ("d'une manière tranchante") regarding his brother
- The "princess" and others teased him about it
- Makaroff apologized to Marie's father (Papa) but was rebuffed
- He became very embarrassed and confused by the situation
- This incident reveals the delicate social dynamics among the Russian expatriate community

### His Brother
References to Makaroff's brother suggest:
- Described as "cet espèce de fou" (that kind of madman)
- Source of embarrassment or concern for Makaroff
- The brother said "impertinences" during social gatherings

## Social Position

Makaroff's position appears complex:
- **Professional Respect**: Valued as an educator
- **Social Awkwardness**: Often the subject of mockery in social situations
- **Russian Expatriate Community**: Part of the Russian circle in Nice but not fully accepted socially

## Teaching Style

While Marie doesn't detail his teaching methods, her comment about him being an "excellent professor" despite his personal quirks suggests he was:
- Knowledgeable in his subject
- Effective in his instruction
- Professional in his teaching role

## Relationship with the Bashkirtseff Family

The relationship appears professionally cordial but socially strained:
- Regular presence for lessons
- Involved in family social situations
- Subject to Marie's sharp observations and judgments
- Some tension with Marie's father

## Historical Context

Private tutors and teachers were essential for the education of aristocratic children in the 19th century, especially for Russian families living abroad. These teachers often occupied an awkward social position - necessary for the family but not quite equals.
