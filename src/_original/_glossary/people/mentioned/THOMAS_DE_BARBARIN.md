# Thomas de Barbarin

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-23
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1880-11-21

French acquaintance who attends Marie's social gatherings in Paris in late 1880.

**References in diary:**
- 1880-11-21: Thomas de Barbarin arrives very late to the small evening party at Mme Engelhardt's house. He is the only person Marie and her aunt invite from among the attendees.

The fact that Marie specifically mentions inviting him suggests he was considered an appropriate and desirable addition to her own social circle. His late arrival is noted, possibly suggesting he was coming from another engagement.

**Social context:**
- Part of Marie's Paris social circle
- Acceptable guest for invitation to Marie's home
- May be from aristocratic or upper bourgeois family (the "de" particle suggests nobility)
