## Mentions in the Diary

- **February 25, 1873** (Mardi Gras): During the carnival procession, Tarnakoff rode in the Bashkirtseff carriage with Marie, her mother, Sophie, and Dina. Baron Bach also joined them for part of the time. Marie notes that Tarnakoff was with them "but not for long."

## Historical Context

During the carnival festivities, it was common for gentlemen to join ladies' carriages for parts of the procession, creating impromptu social groupings as they followed the parade route. This was an acceptable form of mixed-gender socializing under the supervision of married ladies like Marie's mother.

The brief nature of Tarnakoff's participation suggests either:
- He had other social obligations during the carnival
- He was making the rounds among different carriages in his social circle
- The arrangement was somewhat informal and casual
