Russian or German woman in Marie's Paris social circle in late 1880. She hosts small evening gatherings attended by Marie and other Russian expatriates.

**References in diary:**
- 1880-11-21: Marie attends small evening party at Mme Engelhardt's home. She goes specifically so people won't say she's ill. Several Russian ladies attend, and Marie and her aunt make new acquaintances. Mme Engelhardt later thanks Marie profusely for coming, saying Marie "who goes nowhere" was "the most amiable thing in the world" to make an exception in her favor.

Marie's attendance at this gathering shows her awareness of social obligations and her desire to maintain appearances of health despite her ongoing medical issues. The gathering seems to have been a modest affair with tea and conversation, typical of expatriate Russian social circles in Paris.

**Social context:**
- Part of Russian expatriate community in Paris
- Hosts informal evening receptions
- Knows Marie's reputation for rarely attending social events
