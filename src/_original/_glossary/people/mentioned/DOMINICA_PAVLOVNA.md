- **January 25**: Sends telegram through consul informing Georges that their son Étienne is dying after self-inflicted knife wounds. The news is kept from both Georges and Dina.
- **February 25**: Writes letter announcing Étienne's death by dagger. Reveals that during his illness, Étienne asked for his photo to be sent to "Moussia 'qu'il aime encore sans espérance depuis l'enfance'" (whom he still loves hopelessly since childhood). She adds "ces lignes désagréables, surprenantes et étranges" according to Marie. Also mentions Étienne kept Marie's photograph near him.
