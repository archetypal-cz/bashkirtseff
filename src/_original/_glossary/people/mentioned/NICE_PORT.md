The port of Nice, visited by Marie on May 3, 1873. She goes there with Mlle Collignon in a carriage, initially joking about going to "see yachts."

To her surprise, the first thing she sees is a sailing yacht with an English flag and a ducal coronet, which causes her great excitement as she wonders if it could belong to the Duke of Hamilton.

The port would have been located in the eastern part of Nice, separate from the fashionable beachfront promenades. It served both commercial vessels and the luxury yachts of wealthy visitors.
