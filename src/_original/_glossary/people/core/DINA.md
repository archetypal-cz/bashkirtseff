## Basic Information

%% GLO_DINA.0002 %%
Dina Babanina (also spelled Babanin) was Marie Bashkirtseff's cousin and a significant figure in her life. She appears in Marie's diary as a close companion and is also depicted in several of Marie's artworks.

## Family Background

%% GLO_DINA.0004 %%
Dina was the daughter of Georges Babanine, Marie's maternal uncle, making her Marie's first cousin.
According to Marie's 1884 preface, Georges married at age 20 "une belle veuve de trente-six ans, mère de plusieurs enfants" (a beautiful widow of 36, mother of several children). Dina was born from this marriage: "Dina est sa fille" (Dina is his daughter).
The marriage ended in separation ("Séparé de sa femme bien entendu"), which explains why Dina's background was tumultuous. Her father Georges was an alcoholic genius who caused endless family scandal, and her mother was a much older widow who had children from a previous marriage.
This background - with parents separated, a father known for alcoholism and criminal behavior, and a mother significantly older than her father - contrasted with Marie's more stable environment, though both girls were part of the same extended Babanine family.

## Relationship with Marie

%% GLO_DINA.0006 %%
Despite their different circumstances, Dina and Marie shared a close, lifelong bond. They traveled together with Marie's mother and participated in social events, as evidenced by Marie's January 30, 1873 diary entry: "Maman et Dina sont à une matinée musicale à l'hôtel Chauvain, au profit d'un pauvre Russe" (Mother and Dina are at a musical matinee at the Chauvain hotel, for the benefit of a poor Russian).
Their relationship extended beyond family ties to include intellectual companionship. In Marie's final days, as her health deteriorated from tuberculosis, Dina stayed by her side, reading novels to her and offering comfort during her illness.

## Appearances in Marie's Art

%% GLO_DINA.0008 %%
Marie depicted Dina in multiple artworks, including:
1. A pastel portrait titled *Dina Babanine* completed in 1883
2. *The Reader* (also known as *La Liseuse*), a painting where Dina appears as a thoughtful young woman reading a serious and controversial book
These artistic depictions reflect both their personal relationship and Marie's broader interest in portraying women engaged in intellectual pursuits. *The Reader* in particular conveys both intelligence and the role of women in society, aligning with Marie's advocacy for female independence and equality.

## Historical Context

%% GLO_DINA.0010 %%
The relationship between Marie and Dina provides insight into family dynamics among the Russian aristocracy living abroad in the late 19th century. Despite differences in their social standing, their close bond demonstrates how extended family connections remained important within expatriate communities.
Dina's presence in Marie's life and art also reflects the importance of female companionship and solidarity in an era when women's opportunities were limited. Their intellectual camaraderie suggests a shared interest in literature and ideas that transcended the conventional expectations for young women of their time.
