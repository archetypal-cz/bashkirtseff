%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0001 %%
## Identity

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0002 %%
Alexandre was one of Marie's uncles, a son of [#Grand_papa](Grand_papa.md). Marie describes him and his wife as forming "un couple excessivement rapace, cupide et heureux" (an excessively rapacious, greedy and happy couple).

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0003 %%
## The Marriage to Nadine Martinoff (Book 00)

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0004 %%
### The Setup

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0005 %%
Alexandre's most notable action in Marie's retrospective preface is his calculated marriage to [#Nadine_Martinoff](Nadine_Martinoff.md), the young orphan adopted by his aunt [#Vassilissa_Babanine](Vassilissa_Babanine.md).
When 14-year-old Nadine arrived at Grand-papa's estate at [#Tcherniakovka](Tcherniakovka.md):
- She had abandoned her benefactor Vassilissa
- She brought with her about 20,000 rubles
- Alexandre was described as "très pratique" (very practical)
- He "endoctrinated" her ("l'endoctrinait")
- Marie adds parenthetically "(elle aussi)" - she too was practical

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0006 %%
### The Marriage

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0007 %%
They married as soon as Nadine reached 15½ years old. Grand-papa was furious about the marriage, though Marie notes that "presque tous ses fils se sont mariés sans le lui dire" (almost all his sons married without telling him) - suggesting this defiance was typical.

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0008 %%
### The Rapacious Couple

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0009 %%
Marie's characterization is devastating: "Ça a fait un couple excessivement rapace, cupide et heureux" (That made an excessively rapacious, greedy and happy couple).
**Rapace** (rapacious): Like a bird of prey, seizing opportunities
**Cupide** (greedy): Focused on money and material gain
**Heureux** (happy): Content in their mercenary partnership

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0010 %%
### Treatment of Vassilissa

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0011 %%
After Grand-papa's departure from Tcherniakovka, Alexandre and Nadine:
- Relegated Vassilissa (who had adopted and enriched Nadine) to a miserable room
- Left her in an old pavilion where she died
- Abandoned the woman who had been "belle, riche, jeune, élégante, charmante et spirituelle" in her youth
- This despite Vassilissa having been "toujours vénérée" by the family

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0012 %%
## Legal Agent (1880)

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0013 %%
In October 1880, Alexandre served as the family's legal representative in Russia:
- Marie's mother was bound as guarantor for 200,000 rubles in a lawsuit
- M. Bashkirtseff (Marie's father) had signed as surety for her
- Alexandre went to St. Petersburg to attempt to have this legal constraint lifted
- Marie was uncertain whether he would succeed
- The complicated Russian legal proceedings could drag on for months
This reveals Alexandre's continuing role handling difficult legal and administrative matters for the family.

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0014 %%
## Character Analysis

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0015 %%
Marie's portrait suggests Alexandre was:
**Calculating**: "Très pratique" - ruthlessly practical in pursuing advantage
**Opportunistic**: Saw Nadine's 20,000 rubles and acted decisively
**Manipulative**: "Endoctrinated" a 14-year-old girl to secure her fortune
**Defiant**: Married without Grand-papa's permission, part of family pattern
**Cruel**: Relegated his aunt Vassilissa to poverty after profiting from her adopted daughter
**Reliable**: Despite his character, handled family legal matters competently

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0016 %%
## Historical Context

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0017 %%
Alexandre's behavior reflects several aspects of 19th century Russian society:
**Early Marriage**: 15½ was legal and not uncommon, especially with parental defiance
**Fortune Hunting**: Transparent pursuit of Nadine's 20,000 rubles
**Generational Conflict**: Sons regularly defied fathers over marriage choices
**Family Business**: Despite personal conflicts, families relied on members for legal/administrative work
**Provincial Morality**: Actions that would scandalize in capitals were tolerated in provincial estates

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0022 %%
## Marie's Perspective

%% GLO_ALEXANDRE.0023 %%
Marie includes Alexandre's story as an example of family ruthlessness and mercenary calculation. The detail that he and Nadine were "heureux" (happy) in their greed suggests her contempt - they were content with their moral compromises.
The betrayal of Vassilissa - relegating to poverty the very woman whose adopted daughter enriched Alexandre - exemplifies the family's capacity for ingratitude and cruelty.
