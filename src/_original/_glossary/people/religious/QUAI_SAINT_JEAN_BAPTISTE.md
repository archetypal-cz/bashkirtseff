A quay or street in Nice where Marie ordered a dress on April 15, 1873.

## Context
Marie had been in crisis over her lack of suitable spring dresses, crying for days about having nothing appropriate to wear as the weather warmed. On April 15, she ordered "une robe de batiste écrue, très jolie" (an ecru batiste dress, very pretty) from a dressmaker on Quai Saint-Jean-Baptiste.

This order instantly improved her mood: "c'est cela qui me tourmentait, maintenant je suis contente" (that's what was tormenting me, now I'm happy).

The same day she also ordered a hat at Rue Gioffredo styled like Mlle de Galve's in Italian straw.

## Historical Context
The Quai Saint-Jean-Baptiste likely refers to a waterfront street in Nice's old town or port area. In the 1870s, Nice's quays would have housed various shops and commercial establishments.
