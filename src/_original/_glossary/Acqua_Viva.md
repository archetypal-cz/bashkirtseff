# Acqua Viva

## Basic Information

Acqua Viva (meaning "Living Water" in Italian) was the Bashkirtseff family's former residence in Nice, which they had occupied before moving to the despised Villa Baquis in 1873. The villa represented everything that Villa Baquis was not - elegance, proper social standing, and respectability.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Acqua Viva held deep emotional significance for Marie:
- **Symbol of Lost Status**: Represented the family's former, more prestigious position in society
- **Object of Nostalgia**: Marie refers to it as "notre chérie, bien-aimée, adorée Acqua Viva" (our dear, beloved, adored Acqua Viva)
- **Standard of Comparison**: Everything at Villa Baquis was measured against the superior accommodations at Acqua Viva
- **Source of Grief**: The loss of this residence brought Marie to tears

The move from Acqua Viva to Villa Baquis represented more than just a change of address - it was a tangible sign of the family's declining fortunes and social position.

## Historical Context

Villa names in Nice often reflected the romantic sensibilities of the era. "Acqua Viva" suggests a property with notable water features - perhaps fountains, a view of the sea, or proximity to one of Nice's streams. Such villas were typically located in the more fashionable districts and would have had proper reception rooms, gardens, and accommodations suitable for entertaining society.
