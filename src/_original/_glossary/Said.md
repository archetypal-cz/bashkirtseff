# Saïd

## Overview

Saïd appears to be a servant or staff member in the Bashkirtseff household in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned briefly in Marie's September 17, 1873 diary entry when she discusses ordering a livery (uniform) for him.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Saïd in her September 17, 1873 diary entry:

> "A quatre heures, je veux sor­tir pour commander une livrée à Saïd, des bottes pour moi et je ne me souviens plus quoi encore."
> 
> (At four o'clock, I want to go out to order a livery for Saïd, boots for myself, and I don't remember what else.)

This brief mention suggests that Saïd was a servant or staff member for whom Marie was ordering a uniform. The fact that Marie was responsible for ordering his livery indicates her role in managing certain household affairs, despite her young age.

## Historical Context

The name "Saïd" is Arabic in origin, suggesting he may have been from North Africa, possibly Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco, which were French colonies or protectorates during this period. It was not uncommon for wealthy European families in the late 19th century to employ servants from the colonies.

Liveries were uniforms worn by household servants, particularly those who had public-facing roles such as footmen, coachmen, or valets. The fact that Marie was ordering a livery for Saïd suggests he may have had one of these roles, possibly as a footman or personal attendant who would accompany family members in public.

In the social hierarchy of a wealthy household in the 1870s, the appearance of servants was considered a reflection of the family's status. Well-dressed servants in proper liveries were a sign of wealth and social standing. Marie's attention to ordering a livery for Saïd reflects this concern with maintaining appropriate appearances.

## Possible Roles

Based on the limited information available, Saïd might have been:

1. A footman who would accompany family members on outings, open doors, carry packages, etc.
2. A personal attendant to Marie or another family member
3. A coachman or assistant to the coachman (though this seems less likely as Marie mentions other coachmen by name elsewhere)
4. A household servant with duties that required him to be seen by visitors, thus necessitating a livery

Without further mentions in the diary, it's difficult to determine Saïd's exact role in the household. However, the fact that Marie was ordering a livery for him indicates he had some visibility or public-facing role that required formal attire.
