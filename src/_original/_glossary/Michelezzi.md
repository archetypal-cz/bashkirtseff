# Michelezzi

## Overview

Michelezzi (first name unknown) was Marie Bashkirtseff's Italian teacher in Nice during 1873. He is mentioned in Marie's September 15, 1873 diary entry when she proudly describes speaking Italian for the first time, causing her teacher to nearly "faint or throw himself out the window" with surprise or delight.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Michelezzi in her September 15, 1873 diary entry:

> "J'ai pour la première fois parlé l'italien aujourd'hui. Le pauvre Michelezzi faillit tomber évanoui ou se jeter par la fenêtre. Je suis contente moi-même, je puis dire que je *parle* le russe, le français, l'anglais et l'italien. J'apprends l'alle­mand et le latin."
> 
> (I spoke Italian for the first time today. Poor Michelezzi nearly fainted or threw himself out the window. I am pleased with myself, I can say that I *speak* Russian, French, English, and Italian. I am learning German and Latin.)

Marie's description of Michelezzi's dramatic reaction suggests either that her progress was unexpectedly good or that he was an expressive, emotional teacher. The fact that she emphasizes this as the "first time" she spoke Italian indicates that previous lessons may have focused on reading, writing, or grammar rather than conversation.

## Historical Context

Italian was an important language for educated Europeans in the 19th century, particularly for those interested in art, music, and culture. Nice's proximity to Italy (having only been annexed by France from the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860) meant that Italian culture and language remained influential in the region.

For a young woman of Marie's social class and artistic aspirations, knowledge of Italian would have been valuable for appreciating opera, reading classical literature, and participating in cosmopolitan society. The Italian language was also practical for travel in Italy, which was a common destination for wealthy Europeans.

## Educational Approach

Based on Marie's description of suddenly speaking Italian for the first time, it appears that Michelezzi's teaching approach may have initially emphasized passive knowledge (reading, grammar) before active production (speaking). This was a common language teaching methodology in the 19th century.

Marie's pride in her linguistic accomplishments is evident in this entry, as she lists the four languages she can now speak (Russian, French, English, and Italian) and mentions two more she is studying (German and Latin). This ambitious language program reflects both her intellectual capabilities and the expectations for educated young women in aristocratic European society.
