# Dina Babanina

## Basic Information

Dina Babanina (also spelled Babanin) was Marie Bashkirtseff's cousin and a significant figure in her life. She appears in Marie's diary as a close companion and is also depicted in several of Marie's artworks.

## Family Background

Dina came from a somewhat tumultuous household compared to Marie. Her parents' marriage was annulled, which rendered Dina and her brother illegitimate according to the social standards of the time. This background contrasted with Marie's more stable and refined environment, though both were part of the same extended family.

Dina was related to Marie through the Babanina family line, which was Marie's mother's maiden name (Maria Stepanovna Babanina).

## Relationship with Marie

Despite their different circumstances, Dina and Marie shared a close, lifelong bond. They traveled together with Marie's mother and participated in social events, as evidenced by Marie's January 30, 1873 diary entry: "Maman et Dina sont à une matinée musicale à l'hôtel Chauvain, au profit d'un pauvre Russe" (Mother and Dina are at a musical matinee at the Chauvain hotel, for the benefit of a poor Russian).

Their relationship extended beyond family ties to include intellectual companionship. In Marie's final days, as her health deteriorated from tuberculosis, Dina stayed by her side, reading novels to her and offering comfort during her illness.

## Appearances in Marie's Art

Marie depicted Dina in multiple artworks, including:

1. A pastel portrait titled *Dina Babanine* completed in 1883
2. *The Reader* (also known as *La Liseuse*), a painting where Dina appears as a thoughtful young woman reading a serious and controversial book

These artistic depictions reflect both their personal relationship and Marie's broader interest in portraying women engaged in intellectual pursuits. *The Reader* in particular conveys both intelligence and the role of women in society, aligning with Marie's advocacy for female independence and equality.

## Historical Context

The relationship between Marie and Dina provides insight into family dynamics among the Russian aristocracy living abroad in the late 19th century. Despite differences in their social standing, their close bond demonstrates how extended family connections remained important within expatriate communities.

Dina's presence in Marie's life and art also reflects the importance of female companionship and solidarity in an era when women's opportunities were limited. Their intellectual camaraderie suggests a shared interest in literature and ideas that transcended the conventional expectations for young women of their time.
