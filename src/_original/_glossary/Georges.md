# Georges

## Basic Information

Georges was a male family member of Marie Bashkirtseff, possibly a brother or cousin, who shared her refined sensibilities and disdain for their reduced circumstances at Villa Baquis. He appears to have been somewhat older than Marie and Paul.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Georges represented an important ally in Marie's social struggles:
- **Sympathetic Confidant**: Shared Marie's horror at their living situation at Villa Baquis
- **Social Equal**: Understood and validated Marie's concerns about their declining social position
- **Drinking Companion**: Attended social dinners and occasionally drank too much
- **Voice of Agreement**: Provided Marie with validation that her complaints were justified

His agreement with Marie's assessment of their situation ("Il est parfaitement d'accord") gave her ammunition in family discussions about their living arrangements.

## Historical Context

In large aristocratic families, alliances often formed between family members who shared similar temperaments or views. Georges appears to have shared Marie's sensitivity to social status and her distress at their reduced circumstances, making him a natural ally in family disputes.
