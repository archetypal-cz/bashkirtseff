# Bête (Princess/Aunt)

## Basic Information

"Bête" (meaning "Beast" in French) was Marie Bashkirtseff's nickname for one of her aunts, likely Princess Romanoff or another female relative who served as a companion and chaperone. The nickname appears to be affectionate despite its literal meaning, as Bête was one of Marie's closest companions during her time in Nice.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Bête played multiple important roles in Marie's daily life:
- **Constant Companion**: Accompanied Marie on daily promenades, shopping trips, and social outings
- **Confidante**: One of the few people with whom Marie could discuss her feelings about the Duke of Hamilton
- **Chaperone**: Provided the required supervision for a young unmarried woman in 1870s society
- **Social Facilitator**: Helped Marie navigate Nice society and provided commentary on social situations

Despite occasionally "justifying her nickname" (as Marie notes when Bête seems slow or dull), she was generally supportive of Marie and even encouraged her romantic fantasies about Hamilton.

## Historical Context

In 19th-century aristocratic society, unmarried young women were rarely allowed to go out unchaperoned. Female relatives often served this role, accompanying their charges to social events, shopping, and promenades. The use of nicknames within Russian aristocratic families was common, often reflecting personality traits or family jokes.
