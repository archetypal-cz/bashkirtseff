An actress at the French Theater in Nice. Marie attended her benefit performance on May 2, 1873.

## Performance details:
- Benefit night featuring several comedic pieces:
  - "Cadet Roussel" - described by Marie as "a farce like I've never seen"
  - "La corde sensible"
  - "Edgard et sa bonne"
- Received about ten bouquets from admirers
- Marie describes her as "une jolie fille, pas bonne actrice, une des dernières" (a pretty girl, not a good actress, one of the last ones)

The phrase "une des dernières" likely refers to her being one of the last performances of the season, as the theater season in Nice would be ending in May.
