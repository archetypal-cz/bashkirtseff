# Soubise

## Overview

Soubise was a woman in Nice who appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a companion or friend of Gioia, the Duke of Hamilton's mistress. Marie mentions her in September 1873 entries, comparing her to someone named "Pitou" and noting her presence with Gioia during encounters in Nice.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie mentions Soubise in her September 15, 1873 diary entry when describing an encounter with Gioia while horseback riding:

> "A la promenade je vois une femme jolie et gracieuse, c'est Gioia, je l'ai reconnue après l'avoir passée. Je retourne of course, elle marche avec la Soubise, fi !"
> 
> (At the promenade I see a pretty and graceful woman, it's Gioia, I recognized her after passing her. I turn around of course, she is walking with Soubise, fie!)

The expression "fi!" suggests Marie's disdain for this association.

In her September 19, 1873 entry, Marie again mentions Soubise when describing another encounter with Gioia:

> "Tout à coup, je vois arriver Gioia avec Pitou (Soubise ressemble au feu Pitou comme une sœur)."
> 
> (Suddenly, I see Gioia arriving with Pitou (Soubise resembles the late Pitou like a sister).)

Later in the same entry, Marie comments on Gioia and Soubise's mode of transportation:

> "Et quelle misère avec La Soubise en fiacre. Est-ce pareil aux années d'avant, non, non."
> 
> (And what misery with Soubise in a hired cab. Is it the same as in previous years, no, no.)

This comment suggests that Marie sees their use of a hired cab (fiacre) as a sign of reduced circumstances compared to previous years.

## Character and Social Position

Based on Marie's limited mentions, we can infer that:

1. Soubise was a woman in Nice society who associated with Gioia, the Duke of Hamilton's mistress
2. She physically resembled someone known as "Pitou" (possibly deceased, given the phrase "feu Pitou")
3. Marie seems to look down on her, as suggested by the dismissive "fi!" after mentioning her
4. Her traveling in a hired cab with Gioia is noted by Marie as a sign of reduced social status compared to previous years

The fact that Marie refers to her as "la Soubise" (with the definite article) might suggest she was known by a title or surname rather than a first name, which was common in referring to certain social classes in 19th century France.

## Historical Context

In the social hierarchy of Nice in the 1870s, women associated with aristocratic men as mistresses or companions often formed their own social circles. Soubise may have been part of this demi-monde - women who were not accepted in respectable society but who moved in wealthy circles due to their relationships with aristocratic or wealthy men.

Marie's comment about Soubise and Gioia using a hired cab suggesting reduced circumstances reflects the importance of maintaining appearances in this social milieu. The type of transportation one used was a significant marker of social status and financial means.
