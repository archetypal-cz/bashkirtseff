A young Spanish woman with shocking social manners. Has at least two younger sisters.

## Diary References

### 1874
- **March 15**: Encounters Marie at Rumpelmayer with two younger sisters. Marie is "stupéfaite de ses manières" (stupefied by her manners) and wonders how she's tolerated in any salon. Dina freezes mid-bite, staring in shock. Called "la jolie Espagnole" (the pretty Spanish woman) but "plus impermise" (more improper/inadmissible).

## Context
- Spanish background despite French surname
- Pretty but socially unacceptable behavior
- Has multiple sisters
- Known to Marie's circle but disapproved of
- Dina's frozen shock shows severity of breach
- Marie questions how society tolerates her

## Research Notes
- "Impermise" unusual word choice - suggests beyond normal impropriety
- Spanish identity with French name suggests mixed background
- The Rumpelmayer setting (elite pastry shop) shows she moves in good circles despite behavior
