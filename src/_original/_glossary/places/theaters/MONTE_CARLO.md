# Monte-Carlo

## Basic Information

Monte-Carlo is a district of the Principality of Monaco, a small sovereign state on the French Riviera. It became internationally famous in the late 19th century for its casino and gambling facilities. The Monte-Carlo Casino, officially opened in 1863, was developed by the Société des Bains de Mer (SBM), founded by François Blanc, with the support of Prince Charles III of Monaco as a way to save the House of Grimaldi from bankruptcy.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Monte-Carlo appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a leisure destination for her family and the Russian expatriate community in Nice. Located just a short distance from Nice, it was easily accessible by train or carriage, making it a popular day-trip destination.

Marie's diary entries reveal that visits to Monte-Carlo were a regular part of her social life. She mentions gambling at the casino, dining at the restaurants, and encountering acquaintances there. These visits provided entertainment and social opportunities for Marie and her family, who were part of the wealthy international community that frequented the French Riviera.

Her September 7, 1873 entry provides a particularly detailed account of a visit to Monte-Carlo, including her participation in gambling (unusual for a 14-year-old girl), her frustration at missing the train back to Nice, and her chance sighting of Gioia (the Duke of Hamilton's mistress) at the casino.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Monte-Carlo was establishing itself as one of Europe's premier gambling and leisure destinations. The success of the casino had transformed Monaco from a poor principality into a wealthy playground for the aristocracy and the nouveau riche. The Belle Époque architecture, luxurious facilities, and the mild Mediterranean climate made it particularly attractive to wealthy Russians, who had begun to establish a significant presence on the French Riviera.

The Monte-Carlo Casino was not just a gambling establishment but a complex that included a theater (the Salle Garnier, opened in 1879), restaurants, and other entertainment facilities. It attracted visitors from across Europe, particularly during the winter season when the wealthy fled the cold northern climates for the Mediterranean.

Monaco did not charge income tax to its residents, making it an attractive place for the wealthy. This tax advantage, combined with the gambling facilities and luxurious amenities, helped establish Monte-Carlo's reputation as a playground for the rich.

## Social Significance

Monte-Carlo served several important social functions for the expatriate community on the French Riviera:

1. **Social Networking**: The casino and its surrounding facilities provided a venue for the international elite to see and be seen, make connections, and display their wealth and status.

2. **Entertainment**: Beyond gambling, Monte-Carlo offered concerts, theatrical performances, and fine dining.

3. **Gambling Culture**: The casino represented a particular form of aristocratic leisure that combined risk-taking, wealth display, and social interaction.

4. **Gender Dynamics**: Marie's participation in gambling, despite her young age, reflects the somewhat more permissive attitudes toward women's behavior in these international resort settings compared to more traditional environments.
