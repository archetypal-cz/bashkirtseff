**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1881-02-24

A demimondaine (courtesan or kept woman) in 1880s Paris, part of the public demi-monde visible at entertainment venues.

## Diary References
- February 24, 1881: Marie sees Léa d'Asco at the Folies-Bergère in the box next to theirs, accompanied by men. Marie notes the commentary about the performance from "ces gens-là" (those people).

## Social Context
D'Asco represents the visible demi-monde - women living outside respectable society through relationships with wealthy men. Such women were regular fixtures at theaters, music halls, and cafés, often seated prominently to display their beauty and their protectors' wealth.

## Notes
The mention suggests d'Asco was recognizable enough for Marie to identify her. Further research needed on her specific identity and prominence in Parisian society.
