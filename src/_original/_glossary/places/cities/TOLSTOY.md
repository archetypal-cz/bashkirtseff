# Tolstoy (Tolstoï)

**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-30
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1874-01-01

## Overview

The Tolstoy family appears 19 times in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary during 1873-1874. While the name immediately brings to mind the famous writer Leo Tolstoy, the diary references appear to be to members of the broader Tolstoy family who were part of the Russian expatriate community in Nice.

## The Tolstoy Connection

The Tolstoys mentioned were likely:
- **Extended Family Members**: The Tolstoy family was large and prominent
- **Not Leo Tolstoy**: The writer was at Yasnaya Polyana during this period
- **Social Peers**: Part of the same aristocratic circles as the Bashkirtseffs
- **Nice Residents**: Either permanent or seasonal residents

## Social Context

The Tolstoy family in Nice:
- Participated in the Russian expatriate social life
- Attended the same events as Marie's family
- Maintained aristocratic Russian customs abroad
- Part of the international winter colony

## Historical Background

The Tolstoy family was:
- **Ancient Russian Nobility**: Counts since Peter the Great's time
- **Extensive Family**: Many branches across Russia and Europe
- **Culturally Prominent**: Beyond Leo, many were involved in arts and letters
- **Internationally Connected**: Comfortable in European capitals

## Relationship to Marie's Circle

The Tolstoys appear as:
- **Regular Acquaintances**: Mentioned matter-of-factly
- **Social Equals**: Part of the same class and nationality
- **Neither Intimate nor Distant**: Professional social relationships
- **Cultural Companions**: Sharing language and customs

## The Writer Question

Why these are likely NOT references to Leo Tolstoy:
- Leo Tolstoy was at his estate during 1873-1874
- He rarely traveled to fashionable resorts
- His spiritual crisis period was beginning
- He disapproved of the lifestyle Marie's diary depicts

These Tolstoys were probably:
- Cousins or distant relatives of the writer
- Maintaining the traditional aristocratic lifestyle
- Part of the "old" Russia that Leo Tolstoy was rejecting

## Cultural Significance

The presence of Tolstoys in Nice represents:
- The breadth of Russian noble families abroad
- The irony of aristocratic life (given Leo's criticism of it)
- The international nature of 19th century nobility
- The preservation of Russian identity in exile

## Questions for Further Research

- Which specific Tolstoy family members were in Nice?
- What was their exact relationship to Leo Tolstoy?
- Did Marie ever meet or mention the famous writer?
- Were these Tolstoys permanent expatriates?
- How did they view their famous relative's increasingly radical views?

## Note on Spelling

Marie uses the French spelling "Tolstoï" which was common in French-speaking circles. This confirms she was writing for a French-reading audience and saw herself as part of international rather than purely Russian society.
