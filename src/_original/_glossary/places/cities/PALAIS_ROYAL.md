A historic palace and theater complex in central Paris (1st arrondissement). By the 1880s, the Palais-Royal included gardens, arcades with shops and cafés, and the Théâtre du Palais-Royal, known for light comedies and vaudevilles.

## Historical Context
Originally Cardinal Richelieu's palace (1630s-40s), the Palais-Royal became a center of Parisian life. In the 19th century, its gardens and arcades were popular for promenading, while its theater specialized in entertaining comedies.

## Reputation in 1880s
The Palais-Royal area maintained a somewhat risqué reputation, with cafés, gambling, and nightlife. The theater itself was respectable but not as prestigious as the Comédie-Française or Opéra.

## Notes
Marie's substitution of the Folies-Bergère for the Palais-Royal shows her attraction to more daring, transgressive experiences.
