## Identity

Viatka (also spelled Vyatka, now called Kirov) was a provincial city in northeastern European Russia, 896 kilometers northeast of Moscow. In the 19th century, it served as a place of administrative exile for political and troublesome subjects.

## Historical Context

**Administrative Exile:**
- Used by tsarist authorities for punishment without formal criminal charges
- Less severe than Siberian exile
- Exiles often lived relatively comfortably
- Could work in local administration or rent houses
- Famous exiles included Alexander Herzen and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin

**19th Century Exile System:**
- Administrative exile required no trial or formal charges
- Authorities could send "troublesome" individuals away from major cities
- Vyatka was far enough to isolate but not as harsh as Siberia
- Exiles often held society evenings and continued cultural activities
- System allowed authorities to remove problems without legal process

## Vyatka as Location

**Geography:**
- On the Vyatka River in European Russia
- Provincial capital of Vyatka Governorate
- Remote but not wilderness
- Cold winters, relatively developed town

**Social Life:**
- Provincial society
- Local nobility and officials
- Exiles often became part of cultural life
- Less sophisticated than Moscow or Petersburg

## Connection to Bashkirtseff Family

In 1865, Georges (Marie's uncle) was "saisi, emballé et envoyé à Viatka entre deux gendarmes" (seized, packed up and sent to Viatka between two gendarmes). Marie's account reveals:

**Why Georges was sent:**
- No single major crime ("Avait-il commis un crime qualifié? Non")
- "Mille misères et mille petites saleté qui embêtaient tout le monde" (A thousand petty troubles and a thousand little filthy deeds that annoyed everyone)
- Pattern of bad behavior: beating officials, playing tricks, antagonizing the province
- Poltava governor had to intervene
- Accumulated grievances rather than one crime

**The Significance:**
- Administrative exile avoided public trial and scandal
- Sent "between two gendarmes" - under guard but not in chains
- Remote enough to remove him from Poltava society
- Beginning of "le drame bête et terrible" (the stupid and terrible drama) that consumed the family

**Family Impact:**
- Started the family's obsession with "saving Georges"
- All family energy went to visiting authorities, writing ministers
- Life consumed by "Georges et les policiers" (Georges and the police)
- Young Marie's mother used her beauty to petition governors on Georges' behalf

## Historical Examples

**Alexander Herzen (1834):**
- Exiled to Vyatka for free-thinking
- Not permitted to return to Moscow until 1842
- Later became famous revolutionary writer

**Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin:**
- Young nobleman from Tver
- Exiled for free-thinking and anti-government statements
- Served as official in gubernatorial chancellery
- Rented house in town center, held society evenings
- Wrote literary works during exile
- Very comfortable conditions

## Administrative Context

The Vyatka exile system reflected Russian autocratic power:
- No habeas corpus or due process required
- Officials could exile troublemakers without trial
- Families often followed exiles voluntarily
- System maintained social control without public scandal
- For nobility, more humiliation than hardship
