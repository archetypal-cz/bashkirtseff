Fellow art student and friend of Marie Bashkirtseff at the Académie Julian in Paris.

**References in diary:**
- 1880-11-21: Marie spends the day with Madeleine Delsarte searching the most eccentric neighborhoods of Paris looking for a model for the competition (concours). They lunch on pastries in the carriage while traveling around the city.

The informal nature of their model-hunting expedition (eating pastries in the carriage, traveling to unusual neighborhoods) suggests a comfortable friendship between the two young women. This was common practice for art students who needed to find suitable models for academic exercises and competitions.

**Context:**
- Student at Académie Julian
- Collaborates with Marie on practical matters like finding models
- Part of Marie's circle of female art students
- Likely from the Delsarte family known for contributions to performance and aesthetics
