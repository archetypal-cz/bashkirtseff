# Romanoff (Uncle)

**Research Status**: Moderate
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Book 00 (1884 preface)

## Identity

Romanoff was Marie's maternal uncle through the Babanine family - a wealthy 40-year-old bachelor who was ensnared in marriage by Marie's family through elaborate social manipulation. He had a sister whom he hadn't seen for twenty years and who was even wealthier than he was.

## Role in Family History

Marie describes in her retrospective preface how her family orchestrated Romanoff's marriage.

### The Yalta Connection

After Marie's mother met Emperor Alexander II at a railway station near Tcherniakovka, the Emperor promised to see her in Yalta. The family went to Yalta, and "Romanoff aussi" (Romanoff too). There was much gossip about "le Romanoff" during this period.

According to Marie: "Maman était très courtisée et l'Empereur lui adressa la parole trois ou quatre fois dans les endroits publics" (Maman was very courted and the Emperor addressed her three or four times in public places).

### The Marriage Arrangement

After returning to Odessa, the family stayed in the same hotel as Romanoff. Marie describes the decision:

> "Et un beau matin chacun se dit qu'il fallait en finir et que ma tante ne trouverait jamais un aussi beau parti. Il fallait seulement le consentement du monsieur."

(And one fine morning everyone said that it must be ended and that my aunt would never find such a good match. They only needed the gentleman's consent.)

However, obtaining Romanoff's consent was easy because he was "une grosse bête habitué à nous tous, et pas le moins du monde amant de maman, quoiqu'on ait dit" (a big fool used to all of us, and not at all Maman's lover, whatever people said).

Even nine-year-old Marie deployed her eloquence: "Moi-même j'y déployais mon éloquence de neuf ans" (I myself deployed my nine-year-old eloquence).

They married, and the couple returned to Tcherniakovka. Marie notes cryptically: "[Cinq lignes cancellées]" (Five lines cancelled).

### Mental Illness

Just three days after arriving at Tcherniakovka:

> "Trois jours après notre arrivée grand-maman mourait subitement. Et Romanoff devint malade avec des accès de délire et de folie."

(Three days after our arrival, grandmother died suddenly. And Romanoff became ill with fits of delirium and madness.)

Marie adds "[Deux lignes cancellées]" (Two lines cancelled), suggesting she wrote something she later thought better of revealing.

"On le soigna très bien" (They took very good care of him), which is why Dr. Walitsky was essential for the 1870 European journey.

### Earlier Courtship (from Previous Research)

From an earlier part of Marie's preface, we know Romanoff had been involved in more elaborate courtship:
- **Social Entrapment**: The family gathered at Akhtyrka specifically to "catch" Romanoff
- **Marie's Mother as Bait**: Initially used to attract him
- **Lavish Display**: Romanoff fell in love with Marie's mother and spent extravagantly on the family
- **Theater Boxes**: Every evening he sent tickets for theater boxes where the family would parade
- **Luxury Treats**: Trays of fruits and bonbons brought at each intermission
- **Crimean Travel**: He financed the family's trip to Yalta

## Social Context

Romanoff's story illustrates the financial pressures and social maneuvering common among Russian aristocratic families in the mid-19th century. His wealth made him a target for families needing to secure their financial position.

The fact that he was estranged from his own (wealthier) sister for twenty years suggests family discord or geographical separation common in the sprawling Russian Empire.

## Connection to Other Family Members

The story of Romanoff appears in the same narrative section where Marie discusses:
- [#Vassilissa_Babanine](Vassilissa_Babanine.md) - Grand-papa's sister, another wealthy relative
- [#Georges](Georges.md) - Family member who orchestrated the entrapment
- [#Maman](Maman.md) - Used as the romantic bait

## Historical Context

In 19th century Russia, wealthy bachelors like Romanoff were prized marriage prospects. The elaborate social rituals described - theater boxes, constant entertainment, trips to fashionable resorts - were standard courtship displays among the Russian aristocracy.
