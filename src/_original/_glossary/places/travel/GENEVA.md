## Identity
Geneva (French: Genève) is a Swiss city that served as a crucial refuge for the Bashkirtseff family during the Franco-Prussian War (1870) and remained a place Marie appreciated for short visits throughout her life.

## Historical Significance for the Bashkirtseffs

### 1870: War Refuge

In Book 00, Marie writes:
> "Tout cela nous amène à Bade en 1870. La guerre étant déclarée, nous avons filé sur Genève." (All this brings us to Baden in 1870. War being declared, we fled to Geneva.)

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in July 1870, the Bashkirtseff family fled from Baden-Baden (in German territory) to neutral Geneva. This marked a turning point in Marie's life:

- **Safety in neutrality**: Switzerland's neutrality made Geneva a safe haven for displaced international aristocrats
- **French-speaking refuge**: Geneva provided linguistic continuity for the French-speaking Bashkirtseffs
- **Temporary sanctuary**: The family stayed until they could determine their next permanent residence
- **Gateway to Nice**: From Geneva, the family eventually moved to Nice, where they would settle

### Accommodations in Geneva (1870)

**Hôtel de la Couronne** (paragraph 00.43):
> "A Genève, nous avons logé à l'hôtel de la Couronne au bord du lac, c'était charmant."

- Located on the lakeshore (au bord du lac)
- Marie found it charming
- Their initial lodging upon arrival

**Pension Huberkoller** (paragraph 00.44):
> "A ce moment nous avions quitté l'hôtel de la Couronne pour loger dans une pension de famille, pension Huberkoller, et le Mont Blanc était en face de nous."

- Family boarding house (pension de famille)
- View of Mont Blanc from their windows
- Where Marie had her first significant drawing lesson from nature

### Marie's Drawing Lesson from Nature (paragraph 00.44)

A pivotal artistic moment occurred at Pension Huberkoller:

> "On m'a donné un professeur de dessin qui a apporté des modèles à copier. De petits chalets où les fenêtres étaient dessinées commes des troncs d'arbres et qui ne ressemblaient pas aux vraies fenêtres des vrais chalets. Aussi je n'en ai pas voulu, ne comprenant pas qu'une fenêtre soit faite ainsi. Alors le vieux bonhomme m'a dit de copier la vue de la fenêtre tout bonnement d'après nature."

Young Marie (age 11-12):
- **Rejected stylized models**: Refused to copy unrealistic chalet drawings
- **Demanded realism**: Couldn't understand why windows should be drawn as "tree trunks"
- **Drew from nature**: Teacher had her copy the view from their window instead
- **Drew Geneva and the lake**: "J'ai donc copié scrupuleusement ce que je voyais de Genève et du lac"

This early insistence on realism and drawing from nature foreshadowed Marie's later commitment to naturalistic art at the Académie Julian.

### Social Encounter: M. Bachmakoff (paragraph 00.46)

The family encountered M. Bachmakoff at church in Geneva:

> "Maman rencontra un M. Bachmakoff qui était venu placer le petit Chtcherbine dans un pensionnat célèbre de Genève, celui du docteur Hactius."

This chance meeting reconnected Marie's mother with Bachmakoff, a former vice-governor of Poltava who remembered her as a young girl. It illustrates the interconnected networks of Russian nobility across Europe.

### Why Geneva?

Geneva was an ideal refuge for Russian aristocrats fleeing the war zone because:
1. **Neutrality**: Switzerland remained neutral in the Franco-Prussian War
2. **International hub**: Already home to international organizations and expatriate communities
3. **French language**: A French-speaking canton, easing communication
4. **Proximity**: Close to both France and Germany, allowing future flexibility
5. **Aristocratic tradition**: Long history of hosting displaced European nobility
6. **Infrastructure**: Well-developed facilities for wealthy visitors

## Later Visits (1873-1874)

### 1874: Transit City
- **April 1, 1874**: "j'adore Genève pour quinze jours, mais Paris pour toujours" (I adore Geneva for fifteen days, but Paris forever)
- Marie appreciates Geneva for brief visits but not as a permanent residence
- Represents cultured European travel and refinement
- Contrast with her permanent desires (Paris/London)

### Role in Travel Routes
- Station on route between Nice and Paris
- Convenient stopover for journeys across Europe
- Part of the international circuit of fashionable destinations

## Context: Geneva in the 1870s

### International Character
- Major center for international diplomacy and finance
- French-speaking Swiss city with cosmopolitan population
- Haven for political refugees and displaced aristocrats
- Center of watchmaking and banking industries

### Expatriate Society
- Home to Russian, French, English, and other European expatriate communities
- Social scene similar to but less glamorous than Nice or Paris
- Cultural activities including music, theater, and lectures
- Protestant character distinct from Catholic Nice or Paris

### Geographic Position
- At the western tip of Switzerland
- On Lake Geneva (Lac Léman)
- Gateway between France, Switzerland, and Italy
- Easy access to Alpine resorts and French Riviera

## Marie's Relationship to Geneva

Marie's attitude toward Geneva evolved:
1. **1870**: Refuge from war - practical necessity
2. **1874**: Pleasant visit destination - "for fifteen days"
3. **Not permanent**: Unlike Paris or London, Geneva is not a place for "forever"
4. **Respectable but limited**: Cultured and refined but lacking the excitement of Paris

## Historical Context: Franco-Prussian War Refugees

During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871):
- Many international families fled German territories to Switzerland
- Geneva received significant numbers of displaced aristocrats and wealthy families
- Swiss authorities managed humanitarian efforts for refugees
- In February 1871, even General Bourbaki's defeated French army (84,271 men) crossed into Switzerland
- The war created a refugee crisis that Geneva helped address
