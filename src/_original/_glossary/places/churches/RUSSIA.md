# Russia

## Overview

Russia plays a significant role in Marie Bashkirtseff's identity and background. Though she spent much of her life in Western Europe, Marie was born in Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) and maintained strong cultural and familial ties to Russia throughout her life.

## Marie's Russian Background

Marie Bashkirtseff (Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva) was born on November 24, 1858, in Gavrontsi near Poltava in what is now Ukraine but was then part of the Russian Empire. She came from a wealthy noble family with estates in Ukraine. Her father, Konstantin Bashkirtseff, was a marshal of nobility in the Poltava region.

When Marie was about 12 years old, her mother, Maria Stepanovna Bashkirtseva (née Babanina), separated from her father and took Marie and her brother to travel throughout Europe, eventually settling primarily in Nice, France. Despite living abroad, the family maintained their Russian customs, language, and connections.

## Russian Cultural Elements in Marie's Diary

Throughout her diary, Marie makes numerous references to Russian customs, holidays, and cultural practices:

1. **Russian New Year**: In her January 13, 1873 entry, Marie mentions "Notre nouvel an" (Our New Year), referring to the Russian Orthodox New Year, which was celebrated according to the Julian calendar, 13 days after the Western (Gregorian calendar) New Year.

2. **Russian Orthodox Church**: Marie and her family attended Russian Orthodox services, maintaining their religious ties to their homeland.

3. **Russian Language**: Though Marie wrote her diary primarily in French, she was fluent in Russian and occasionally used Russian expressions or referenced conversations in Russian.

4. **Russian Social Circle**: In Nice and Paris, Marie's family maintained connections with other Russian expatriates and aristocrats, forming a social circle that preserved Russian cultural practices and social norms.

## Russia in the 1870s

During the period covered in Marie's diary, Russia was undergoing significant changes:

1. **Political Context**: Tsar Alexander II (reigned 1855-1881) had implemented major reforms, including the emancipation of serfs in 1861, but Russia remained an autocratic empire with significant social stratification.

2. **International Relations**: Russia's relations with Western Europe were complex during this period. The Crimean War (1853-1856) had ended in Russia's defeat, but by the 1870s, Russia was rebuilding its international position.

3. **Russian Aristocracy Abroad**: Many wealthy Russian nobles, like the Bashkirtseff family, spent significant time in Western Europe, particularly in resort cities like Nice, creating expatriate communities that blended Russian traditions with Western European lifestyles.

4. **Cultural Developments**: This was a period of significant cultural development in Russia, with writers like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky producing major works, and Russian music and art gaining international recognition.

## Marie's Relationship with Russia

Marie's relationship with her Russian heritage was complex:

1. **Cultural Identity**: While Marie embraced French culture and artistic traditions, she maintained aspects of her Russian identity throughout her life.

2. **Social Status**: Her status as a Russian noblewoman was an important part of her social identity in Western European society.

3. **Family Connections**: Despite living abroad, Marie maintained connections with relatives in Russia and Ukraine.

4. **Artistic Recognition**: Later in her life, as Marie developed her artistic career, her Russian background became part of her artistic identity in the Parisian art world.

## Historical Significance

Marie's diary provides valuable insights into the lives of Russian expatriate nobility in Western Europe during the late 19th century. Her documentation of Russian customs practiced abroad, her family's social connections, and her own complex cultural identity offers a window into the transnational nature of European aristocratic society during this period.

The Russian elements in Marie's diary also highlight the significant Russian cultural presence in places like Nice during the late 19th century, when Russian aristocrats formed an important part of the international social scene in European resort cities.
