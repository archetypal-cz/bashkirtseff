**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1873-02-12

A family in Nice society with whom Marie's family dined on the evening of February 11, 1873. Marie refers to them as "les S..." using the abbreviated form typical of her diary when she wants to preserve some discretion about identities.

## Context

The family hosted a dinner that Marie's family attended while Marie herself went out separately with Prater. This suggests the S... family were part of the adult social circle rather than families with young people Marie's age.

## Social Significance

The casual mention indicates regular social contact and an established relationship with the Bashkirtseff family in Nice society.
