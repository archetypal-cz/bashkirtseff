A fashionable boulevard in Paris's 8th and 17th arrondissements, connecting Place de la Madeleine to Parc Monceau. In the late 19th century, it was an elegant residential area with townhouses (hôtels particuliers) housing wealthy Parisians.

## Historical Context
Developed under Haussmann's renovation of Paris (1850s-1860s), Boulevard Malesherbes epitomized Second Empire and early Third Republic Parisian elegance. The wide tree-lined avenue with its mansions attracted wealthy bourgeois and aristocratic residents.

## In Marie's Life
- **Cassagnac's residence**: Number 161 Boulevard Malesherbes is where Paul de Cassagnac lives

## Diary References
- February 19, 1881: Marie invents a pretext about viewing a townhouse with studio on Boulevard Malesherbes to get her aunt to walk past #161 where Cassagnac lives. She describes it as "ça a l'air vieux avec... comme des persiennes vertes, ça a l'air province et pas grand" (it looks old with... like green shutters, looks provincial and not large). She's ashamed of her curiosity and her lie, but feels something when seeing his building. She wants to return if she can escape alone.

## Marie's Emotions
This entry reveals the depth of Marie's obsession with Cassagnac - she invents elaborate lies just to walk past his residence, feels shame at her curiosity, yet cannot help herself. The quiet desperation is palpable.
