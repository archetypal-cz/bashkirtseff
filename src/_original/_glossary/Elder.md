# Miss Elder

## Basic Information

Miss Elder was Marie Bashkirtseff's English governess or teacher in Nice during 1873. As was common among aristocratic Russian families, English governesses were employed to teach language, deportment, and provide cultural education to young ladies.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Elder served several roles in Marie's education and daily life:
- **Language Instructor**: Taught Marie English, which she already spoke well
- **Literary Advisor**: Was "astonished" when Marie announced her intention to publish an article critiquing "A Journey across the central plains of Europe"
- **Cultural Mediator**: Provided Marie with information about social admirers, such as the American boy who "admired" her

Her reaction to Marie's literary ambitions reveals the unconventional nature of Marie's intellectual pursuits for a 13-year-old girl in 1873.

## Historical Context

English governesses were highly sought after by Continental aristocratic families in the 19th century. They were expected to provide not just language instruction but also to impart British manners and cultural knowledge, which were considered essential for young ladies entering international society. The governess occupied an ambiguous social position - neither family nor servant, educated but dependent.
