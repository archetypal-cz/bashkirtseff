# Paris in the 1870s

## Basic Information

Paris in the 1870s was a city in transition, recovering from the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and the Paris Commune uprising (1871) while reestablishing itself as the cultural and fashion capital of Europe. The early 1870s marked the beginning of the Third Republic in France, a period of political reorganization following the fall of Napoleon III's Second Empire.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff visited Paris in August 1873 and developed a deep admiration for the city. Her diary entries reveal her enthusiasm for Paris as the cultural and fashion capital of the world. She writes passionately about the city's atmosphere, the quality of the people she sees, and her desire to eventually move there from Nice.

Marie's statement that "Tous les endroits sont égaux pour moi excepté Paris que j'adore et Nice que j'abhorre" (All places are equal to me except Paris, which I adore, and Nice, which I abhor) reveals her strong preference for the cultural and social opportunities of Paris over the provincial atmosphere of Nice.

For Marie, Paris represented opportunity, sophistication, and the possibility of achieving her artistic and social ambitions. Her shopping experiences at prestigious establishments like the House of Worth, her visits to cultural venues, and her observations of Parisian society all reinforced her desire to establish herself in this cosmopolitan environment.

## Historical Context

Paris in 1873 was in a period of recovery and transformation. The city had suffered significant damage during the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent Paris Commune uprising. The siege of Paris (September 1870 to January 1871) had caused severe hardship, and the violent suppression of the Commune in May 1871 had resulted in thousands of deaths and the destruction of numerous buildings.

By 1873, reconstruction efforts were underway, guided by urban planner Baron Haussmann's earlier vision of a modern city with wide boulevards, grand public spaces, and improved infrastructure. The Third Republic, established in 1870, was still consolidating its political structures, with monarchist factions maintaining significant influence in the early 1870s.

Despite these challenges, Paris was regaining its position as a center of culture, fashion, and society. The city's theaters, opera houses, and other cultural venues were active, and its fashion houses, including the House of Worth, continued to set international trends. The Parisian elite maintained their social rituals, including promenades in the Bois de Boulogne and attendance at the opera and theater.
