# Villa Baquis (Villa Buffa)

## Basic Information

Villa Baquis, which Marie contemptuously calls "Buffa," was the Bashkirtseff family's residence in Nice during 1873. Located in what Marie considered an inferior neighborhood, the villa represented a significant step down from their previous accommodations and became a symbol of the family's declining social position.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

The villa was a source of constant mortification for Marie:
- **Social Embarrassment**: Marie felt the residence was beneath their station, calling it "une auberge" (an inn) and "un trou" (a hole)
- **Physical Inadequacy**: She complained about the dark staircase, small miserable salon, poor entrance, and general shabbiness
- **Symbol of Decline**: Represented their fall from their beloved former residence, Acqua Viva
- **Social Limitation**: Marie believed the poor address affected their ability to maintain proper social connections

Her hatred of the villa reveals her acute sensitivity to social status and her understanding that address and appearances mattered enormously in 19th-century society.

## Historical Context

In 19th-century Nice, as in most European resort towns, one's address was a crucial indicator of social standing. The international aristocracy who wintered on the Riviera were acutely aware of which neighborhoods and villas were fashionable. A family's choice of residence could determine their social opportunities and the caliber of guests they could receive.

Nice in the 1870s was divided into distinct quarters, with the most fashionable families residing in villas along the Promenade des Anglais or in the hills above the town.
