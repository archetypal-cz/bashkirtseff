### 1874
- **January 17**: At the theater in a ground floor box. Marie describes her as beautiful, especially her face, with a "nonchalant, ivre, languissant et gaillard" (nonchalant, drunk, languishing and lusty) air. Compares her to Phryne or Lais (famous Greek courtesans).

## Marie's Analysis
- Admires her beauty but finds it different from Gioia's
- Classical beauty of face vs Gioia's modern allure
- Gioia superior in "port, de manière, de taille" (bearing, manner, figure)
- Represents the demimonde Marie observes with fascination

## Context
- Part of Nice's courtesan culture
- Theater boxes were display spaces for demimonde
- Marie's classical education shows in hetaera comparisons
