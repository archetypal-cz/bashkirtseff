## Identity
Sir Frederic Johnstone (1841-1913) was a British baronet and racing enthusiast who became one of Marie's romantic obsessions during her time in Nice. He was known for his involvement in the racing world and his connections to the Prince of Wales's circle.

## Marie's Encounter
Marie first spotted Johnstone on January 10, 1875, while riding in a landau with Dina near the Jardin Public in Nice. She describes him as a "galant comme Carlo" - comparing him to her idealized romantic type. This brief encounter made a lasting impression on her.

## Physical Description
Marie observed him walking on the boulevard toward the Promenade des Anglais, hands in his pockets, yawning as their carriage passed. She was struck by his appearance and boldly leaned out of the carriage to get a better look.

## Marie's Obsession
By April 1875, Johnstone had become part of Marie's romantic fantasies alongside the Duke of Hamilton, Prince of Wales, and others. She writes passionate invocations to him: "Johnstone beau, Johnstone noble, Johnstone fier, Johnstone charmant, Johnstone grand, viens me visiter en rêve, tu me plais, tu es beau!"

## Historical Context
Johnstone moved in the same social circles as the Prince of Wales and other British aristocrats who wintered in Nice. He represented the type of sophisticated, aristocratic gentleman that Marie idealized.

## Significance in Marie's Development
Johnstone becomes another figure in Marie's gallery of unattainable aristocratic men, reflecting her social aspirations and romantic imagination at age 16-17.
