A person in the Bashkirtseff household who announces visitors. On May 3, 1873, Palajka interrupts Marie to tell her that "Egor Stepanovitch has arrived."

The name suggests this is likely a servant or household staff member of Slavic origin (the -ajka ending is a diminutive form common in Slavic languages).
