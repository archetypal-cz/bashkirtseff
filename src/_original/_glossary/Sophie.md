**Research Status**: Comprehensive
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-30
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1874-01-01

## Identity

Sophie is Marie Bashkirtseff's aunt ("ma tante"), one of the most important figures in her early diary. Throughout 1873-1874, Sophie served as Marie's primary guardian during the family's European travels.

## Confirmed Relationship

The December 1873 entries clearly establish Sophie as "ma tante":
- December 15, 1873: "maman, ma tante, moi, Dina" - Sophie is referenced as "ma tante" in family groupings
- December 25, 1873: Multiple references confirm Sophie is the aunt who:
  - Picks up Marie from social events
  - Participates in family discussions about society figures
  - Makes observations about other people like Gioia

## Role in Marie's Life

Sophie is mentioned as:
- Going on carriage rides and promenades with Marie
- Being taken to visit other ladies in their social circle
- Someone whose readiness (or lack thereof) affects the family's daily plans

## Historical Context

In wealthy 19th century households, it was common to have:
- Young female companions for daughters
- Extended family members staying for the season
- Friends from similar social backgrounds as house guests

The casual way Marie mentions Sophie suggests she is a regular part of the household rather than a formal visitor.

## Appearances in Diary

- February 17, 1873: Not ready for the initial outing, later picked up to visit a lady
