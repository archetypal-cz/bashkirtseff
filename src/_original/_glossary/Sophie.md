**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-28
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1873-02-17

## Identity

Sophie appears to be a member of the Bashkirtseff household in Nice during the winter of 1873. Based on diary entries, she seems to be:

- A companion or friend who accompanies Marie on outings
- Someone of similar social standing who participates in promenades
- Possibly a relative or close family friend staying with them

## Role in Marie's Life

Sophie is mentioned as:
- Going on carriage rides and promenades with Marie
- Being taken to visit other ladies in their social circle
- Someone whose readiness (or lack thereof) affects the family's daily plans

## Historical Context

In wealthy 19th century households, it was common to have:
- Young female companions for daughters
- Extended family members staying for the season
- Friends from similar social backgrounds as house guests

The casual way Marie mentions Sophie suggests she is a regular part of the household rather than a formal visitor.

## Appearances in Diary

- February 17, 1873: Not ready for the initial outing, later picked up to visit a lady
