Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835) was an Italian opera composer of the bel canto era. His opera "La Sonnambula" (The Sleepwalker) was performed at the Cercle de la Méditerranée on February 7, 1873.

## La Sonnambula (The Sleepwalker)

First performed in 1831, "La Sonnambula" is a romantic opera about a young woman who walks in her sleep and is suspected of infidelity. The opera explores themes of:
- Love and misunderstanding
- Innocence proven
- Social reputation
- Eventual recognition and reconciliation

These themes may have resonated with Marie's own romantic preoccupations and concerns about social perception.

## Performance Context

The Vicomtesse Vigier, a former opera singer herself (Sophie Cruvelli), hosted this performance, adding authenticity and prestige to the evening. Marie notes the voice as "magnifique, un peu usée, un peu criarde, mais magnifique."

## Cultural Significance

Bellini's operas were central to 19th-century European cultural life, particularly among the aristocracy. Knowledge of and attendance at opera performances was an essential marker of social sophistication.
