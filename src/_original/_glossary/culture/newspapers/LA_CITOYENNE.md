A French feminist newspaper founded and edited by Hubertine Auclert in 1881. The title "La Citoyenne" (The (Female) Citizen) asserted women's claim to full citizenship rights.

## Historical Context
*La Citoyenne* was the first French feminist newspaper entirely directed by a woman. Published from February 1881 to 1891, it advocated for women's suffrage, legal equality, and social reforms. The newspaper provided a platform for feminist voices and reported on the women's rights movement both in France and internationally.

## Editorial Line
Under Auclert's direction, *La Citoyenne* promoted:
- Women's suffrage as primary goal
- Reform of marriage laws and women's legal status
- Women's economic independence
- Education and professional opportunities for women

## Diary References
- March 2, 1881: Marie mentions wanting to become a shareholder ("actionnaire") in *La Citoyenne* with 500 francs
- March 6, 1881: Marie's article is published in *La Citoyenne*. She writes: "Ça m'empêche d'être contente de voir mon article imprimé dans La Citoyenne. Lisez aussi celui de Hubertine qui est très remarquable."

## Marie's Involvement
Marie is both a financial supporter (wanting to buy shares) and a contributor (publishing articles). This demonstrates her serious engagement with the feminist cause, not merely social dabbling. Publishing in *La Citoyenne* aligned her publicly with the women's suffrage movement.

## Significance
For an aristocratic young woman to invest in and write for a radical feminist newspaper was highly unconventional. It shows Marie's genuine political commitments and her willingness to challenge social expectations.
