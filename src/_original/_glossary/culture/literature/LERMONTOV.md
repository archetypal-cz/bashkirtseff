## Identity

Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov (1814-1841) was one of Russia's greatest Romantic poets, second only to Pushkin in literary fame. Marie mentions him as a contemporary of her maternal grandfather.

## Biography

**Early Life:**
- Born 1814 in Moscow
- Descended from Scottish family Learmonth
- Grew up in Tarkhany estate (now Lermontovo, Penza Oblast)
- Influenced by English literature, especially Byron

**Literary Career:**
- Began writing poetry at age 13, inspired by Lord Byron
- Wrote over 30 long narrative poems and 600 short lyrics
- Author of "A Hero of Our Time" (1840), Russia's first psychological novel
- Major works: "The Demon" (1839), "The Corsair," "The Angel"

**Death:**
- Killed in a duel in 1841 at age 26
- Like Pushkin, died young in a duel
- His early death cemented his legendary status

## Connection to Byron

Lermontov was deeply influenced by Lord Byron:
- Wrote in Byron's Romantic style
- Shared Byron's rebellious spirit
- A friend described him as "married to a hefty volume of Byron"
- This Byronic influence was characteristic of educated Russians of his generation

## The Caucasus Connection

"The poet of the Caucasus":
- Exiled to the Caucasus after writing a poem denouncing Pushkin's killers
- The exile became inspiration - he loved the region from childhood
- Studied local languages and folklore
- Painted Caucasian landscapes extensively
- Wrote celebrated poems about the Caucasus

## Connection to Bashkirtseff Family

Marie identifies her maternal grandfather as "le contemporain de Lermontoff, Pouchkine etc." This places her grandfather in the educated Russian nobility of the 1820s-1840s who:
- Were cultured and literary ("militaire lettré")
- Embraced Byronic Romanticism
- Served in the Caucasus
- Wrote poetry as gentlemen amateurs
- Participated in the intellectual ferment of pre-reform Russia

This generational context helps explain Marie's grandfather's character as a "Byronic" figure who was both military officer and poet.

## Historical Context

Lermontov's generation represented Russian Romanticism at its height:
- Influenced by Western European literature (Byron, Lamartine)
- Increasingly critical of autocracy
- Often exiled for political expression
- Combined military service with literary pursuits
- Died young, often in duels
