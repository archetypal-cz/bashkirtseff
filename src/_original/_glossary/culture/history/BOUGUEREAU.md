William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) was one of the most celebrated French academic painters of the 19th century. He was a professor at the Académie Julian and served as a juror for student competitions and Salon submissions.

**Artistic style:**
Bouguereau was known for his technically perfect, idealized paintings of classical, religious, and allegorical subjects. His work featured smooth, almost photographic realism, particularly in rendering skin tones and the human figure. He was a master of academic technique and champion of traditional French academic art.

**Role at Académie Julian:**
As one of the master professors at the Académie Julian, Bouguereau taught and critiqued students' work. He was particularly significant for female students because, unlike the official École des Beaux-Arts which excluded women, the Académie Julian welcomed them. Bouguereau's willingness to teach women seriously was progressive for his time.

**In Marie's diary:**
- 1880-11-27: Marie mentions Bouguereau as one of the four master judges (along with Lefèvre, Tony Robert-Fleury, and Boulanger) who evaluate the student competition (concours). She notes that earning a medal would mean her head painting was "found good by Bouguereau, Lefèvre, Tony and Boulanger" - indicating the high value she places on these masters' judgment.

**Significance to Marie:**
Bouguereau represented the highest standard of academic painting technique. His approval would validate Marie's technical skills and her place among serious art students. His judgment carried immense weight in determining whether a student's work met professional standards.

**Legacy:**
While Bouguereau's reputation declined in the 20th century when modernism dominated art criticism, recent decades have seen renewed appreciation for his extraordinary technical mastery and his role in art education, particularly his support for women artists.

**Teaching approach:**
Bouguereau emphasized rigorous technical training, perfect drawing, and careful observation of nature. His teaching focused on mastering the human figure through life drawing and achieving flawless execution. These were exactly the skills Marie was working to develop.
