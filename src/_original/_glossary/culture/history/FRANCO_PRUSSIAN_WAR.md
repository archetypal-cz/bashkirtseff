## Overview

The Franco-Prussian War (July 19, 1870 – May 10, 1871) was a conflict between France (under Napoleon III's Second Empire) and Prussia, backed by the North German Confederation and the South German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria. The thorough Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of the German Empire under King William I of Prussia and marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the Third Republic.

## Impact on Marie Bashkirtseff's Family

In Marie's retrospective preface (Book 00), she writes: "Tout cela nous amène à Bade en 1870. La guerre étant déclarée, nous avons filé sur Genève" (All this brings us to Baden [Baden-Baden] in 1870. War being declared, we fled to Geneva).

The declaration of war in July 1870 forced the Bashkirtseff family, who were at the fashionable spa resort of Baden-Baden, to flee to neutral Switzerland (Geneva). This was part of a larger exodus of international visitors from German territories as the war began.

## Context for Russian Families

For Russian aristocratic families like the Bashkirtseffs who were traveling in Western Europe:
- Baden-Baden was a popular summer destination for Russian nobility
- The war made German territories unsafe for foreign visitors
- Switzerland, particularly Geneva, became a refuge for displaced travelers
- Many families used this disruption to reassess their European residences

The timing coincided with another major family event - the death of Marie's grandmother in 1870, which prompted the family's permanent departure from Russia and eventual settlement in Nice, France.

## Humanitarian Aspects

The Geneva Bureau and Swiss authorities played significant roles in humanitarian efforts:
- The Geneva Bureau transmitted correspondence and coordinated relief efforts
- In February 1871, General Bourbaki's defeated French army (84,271 men and 14,000 horses) crossed into Switzerland seeking refuge
- Swiss officials like Geneva State Councillor Arthur Chenevière assisted both Swiss citizens and refugees caught in the conflict

## Historical Significance

The war:
- Lasted from July 1870 to May 1871
- Resulted in German unification
- Led to the fall of the Second French Empire
- Established the German Empire as the dominant continental power
- Displaced many international families traveling in Europe
