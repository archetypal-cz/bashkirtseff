### 1874
- **January 13**: Marie observes Lord Falkner "arm in arm with a gentleman and drunk as a pig" ("ivre comme un cochon"). She notes he is "very often far from being in a state of temperance." She contrasts his dissipated appearance with the Duke of Hamilton's fresh complexion, suggesting Hamilton doesn't drink as much.
