## Diary References

### 1874
- **February 22**: At the Masséna charity sale. Marie notes he is "Chilovski tout à fait, la même manière de parler" (exactly like Chilovski, the same way of speaking). Marie finds his name too long and decides to simply call him "le prince." Woerman tries to make Bec jealous by staying near Marie, almost making her blush about Tchetvertinski.

## Context
- Russian nobility in Nice
- Has distinctive speaking manner reminiscent of Chilovski
- Marie finds his long name cumbersome
- Unwittingly becomes part of Woerman's jealousy games
- Present at charity events
- Part of the younger generation at social events
