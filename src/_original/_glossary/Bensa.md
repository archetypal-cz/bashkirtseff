# Bensa

## Overview

Bensa was one of Marie Bashkirtseff's teachers in Nice during 1873. Based on diary entries, he appears to have been responsible for arranging other professors for Marie's extensive educational program and also taught her directly.

## Mentions in the Diary

Marie first mentions Bensa in her September 1873 diary entries. In the September 9 entry (not yet processed), she refers to him as "one of Marie's teachers who arranges for other professors."

In the September 17, 1873 entry, Marie describes an amusing interaction with Bensa:

> "Mais quelle *riaille* [sic] nous eûmes avec Bensa ! Ce pauvre homme est si drôle ! Dina et moi nous amusons à ne pas le comprendre ou bien lorsqu'il raconte des choses extraordinaires ne pas nous étonner ou encore nier ce qu'on a dit et prouver qu'il fait nuit à midi. Quelque temps il discute, mais enfin il commence à danser, secouer ses mains et ne pousse que des soupirs et des espèces de gémissements: - Ah ! Mlle Dina ! ah ! Mlle Marie !"

This passage reveals that Marie and her cousin Dina would tease Bensa by pretending not to understand him, refusing to be impressed by his "extraordinary things," and arguing absurdities like "proving it's night at noon." Bensa's exasperated reaction - dancing, shaking his hands, and sighing "Ah! Mlle Dina! ah! Mlle Marie!" - shows how they successfully provoked him.

In the same entry, Marie mentions trying to convince Bensa that "the head of Nero is more beautiful than that of Apollo," suggesting that he may have been teaching her about classical art or history.

In the September 19 entry, Marie mentions that Bensa had commented on Gioia's hair: "Bensa en a parlé: j'ai vu cette bel/eu [sic] dame avec de beaux cheveux" (Bensa spoke of it: I saw this beautiful lady with beautiful hair).

## Character and Role

Based on Marie's descriptions, Bensa appears to have been:

1. A somewhat excitable or emotional teacher who could be easily provoked by his students' teasing
2. Someone who arranged for other professors in Marie's educational program
3. Possibly a teacher of art, history, or classical studies
4. Someone who moved in Nice society and was familiar with figures like Gioia

Marie's playful interactions with him suggest she felt comfortable enough to tease him, indicating a less formal teacher-student relationship than might have been typical for the time.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, young women of Marie's social class would typically receive education from private tutors rather than attending schools. Marie's educational program was unusually extensive for a young woman of her time, including multiple languages, sciences, music, and art. Teachers like Bensa would have been hired by wealthy families to provide this private education.
