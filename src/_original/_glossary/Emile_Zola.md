# Émile Zola

## Basic Information

Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (1840-1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, and a major figure in the literary school of naturalism. He was also an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff explicitly connected her diary to Zola's concept of the "document humain" (human document). In her diary's preface, she described it as "très intéressant comme document humain" and directly referenced Zola, telling readers to "Demandez à M. Zola et même à M. de Goncourt, et même à Maupassant!" (Ask Mr. Zola and even Mr. de Goncourt, and even Maupassant!).

Her fascination with Zola's ideas and the naturalist movement began after she started her artistic career at the Académie Julian in 1877. The connection was reinforced through her acquaintance with Jules Bastien-Lepage (1848-1884), which led her to actively participate in the naturalist movement. The aesthetics of naturalism aligned perfectly with her humanist and social views.

When Bashkirtseff was dying in 1884, she deliberately wrote the names of Zola, Goncourt, and Maupassant into her preface, asserting that her diary's value as reading matter lay in its status as a "document humain" - these literary giants would understand and validate its importance as an authentic record of human experience.

Zola's emphasis on detailed documentation of everyday life and his belief in literature as a scientific study of human behavior resonated deeply with Marie's own approach to her diary writing. Though they never met personally, Marie was part of the artistic and literary circles in Paris where Zola's influence was paramount, particularly in the late 1870s and early 1880s when naturalism was at its height.

## Historical Context

Zola was born in Paris in 1840 and became one of the most influential writers of the late 19th century. He is known for his 20-novel series *Les Rougon-Macquart*, which follows two branches of a family during the Second French Empire.

As a prominent figure in the naturalist movement, Zola believed in the objective study of human behavior through literature. His works often depicted the harsh realities of working-class life and tackled controversial social issues.

Zola was also known for his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, publishing the famous open letter "J'Accuse…!" in 1898, which accused the French government of antisemitism in the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus.

## Literary Influence

Zola's naturalist approach emphasized:
- Detailed observation and documentation of reality
- Scientific objectivity in portraying human behavior
- Focus on the influence of heredity and environment on character
- Unflinching portrayal of all aspects of life, including the sordid and unpleasant

His essay "The Experimental Novel" (1880) became the seminal manifesto of naturalism, drawing inspiration from Claude Bernard's essay on experimental medicine. Zola viewed literature as a form of scientific documentation of human behavior and social conditions.

The naturalist movement appeared at the end of the 19th century in a favorable context, with the development of capitalism, the proletariat and large cities, and scientific progress. This offered naturalist writers new investigation methods and content. 

The "Plein Air movement" in painting was parallel to what Zola inaugurated in literature - it was nature taking the citadel of art by storm. Marie Bashkirtseff participated in both movements, applying naturalist principles to her painting and her diary writing.

These principles influenced many writers of Marie's era, and extended the concept of "document humain" beyond fiction into personal writing. Marie's diary, written during the height of naturalism in 1870s-1880s Paris, represents an important example of how personal accounts were valued as authentic scientific records of human experience.

## Mentions in the Diary

While direct mentions of Zola in Marie's diary are limited, his influence on the literary and artistic culture of her time was significant. Marie's own artistic aspirations and her desire to document her life in detail show parallels with the naturalist movement that Zola championed.
