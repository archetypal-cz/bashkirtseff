# Émile Zola

## Basic Information

Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (1840-1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, and a major figure in the literary school of naturalism. He was also an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff was familiar with Zola's work and the naturalist movement. Her diary itself has been considered a "document humain" (human document), a term popularized by naturalist writers like Zola. The raw honesty and detailed observations in Marie's diary align with the naturalist approach to documenting human experience.

Zola's emphasis on detailed documentation of everyday life and his belief in literature as a scientific study of human behavior resonated with Marie's own approach to her diary writing. Though they never met personally, Marie was part of the artistic and literary circles in Paris where Zola's influence was significant.

## Historical Context

Zola was born in Paris in 1840 and became one of the most influential writers of the late 19th century. He is known for his 20-novel series *Les Rougon-Macquart*, which follows two branches of a family during the Second French Empire.

As a prominent figure in the naturalist movement, Zola believed in the objective study of human behavior through literature. His works often depicted the harsh realities of working-class life and tackled controversial social issues.

Zola was also known for his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, publishing the famous open letter "J'Accuse…!" in 1898, which accused the French government of antisemitism in the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus.

## Literary Influence

Zola's naturalist approach emphasized:
- Detailed observation and documentation of reality
- Scientific objectivity in portraying human behavior
- Focus on the influence of heredity and environment on character
- Unflinching portrayal of all aspects of life, including the sordid and unpleasant

These principles influenced many writers of Marie's era, including the way personal accounts and diaries were valued as authentic "human documents."

## Notable Works

- *Thérèse Raquin* (1867)
- *L'Assommoir* (1877) - about alcoholism and poverty in working-class Paris
- *Nana* (1880) - about a prostitute
- *Germinal* (1885) - about a coal miners' strike
- *J'Accuse…!* (1898) - open letter on the Dreyfus Affair

## Mentions in the Diary

While direct mentions of Zola in Marie's diary are limited, his influence on the literary and artistic culture of her time was significant. Marie's own artistic aspirations and her desire to document her life in detail show parallels with the naturalist movement that Zola championed.
