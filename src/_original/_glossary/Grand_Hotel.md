A hotel in Nice mentioned in Marie's diary entry of May 1, 1873. This is where Mlle Collignon's former lover is staying with another woman, causing great distress to the governess.

The Grand Hotel was likely one of the premier hotels in Nice during the 1870s, catering to wealthy visitors during the winter season.
