# Boreel

## Overview

Boreel appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a potential suitor and social acquaintance during her time in Nice in early 1873. He serves as a contrasting figure to the Duke of Hamilton, who was the primary object of Marie's romantic interest.

## Mentions in the Diary

Boreel first appears in Marie's January 14, 1873 entry, where she notes that he "ne m'amuse plus beaucoup" (doesn't amuse me much anymore) and that his "démarche" (gait/bearing) displeases her. This suggests he had previously captured her interest but was now falling out of favor.

In her January 18 entry, Marie mentions that Boreel approached her at the Cercle Masséna, but she responded with "presque rien" (almost nothing), finding her own reaction "strange."

By February 1, Marie explicitly analyzes her feelings, stating: "Pour Boreel, je n'ai pas d'amour" (For Boreel, I have no love). She attempts to compare her feelings for Boreel and the Duke of Hamilton, initially claiming they are equal, but then revealing a clear preference: "Si quand je vois Boreel j'ai de la joie, c'est un rayon de soleil qui pénètre dans mon cœur quand je vois le duc" (If when I see Boreel I feel joy, it's a ray of sunshine that penetrates my heart when I see the Duke).

On February 5, Marie directly compares Boreel's appearance to the Duke's, noting that Boreel was "très bien habillé" (very well dressed) but "moins bien que le duc" (not as good as the Duke) and "décidément trop gros" (decidedly too fat/stout).

In her February 11 entry, Marie describes seeing Boreel at a ball where he appeared to be courting "une jolie Ecossaise" (a pretty Scottish girl). She admits she would have been "furieuse" (furious) if he had danced with another girl in front of her, suggesting some possessiveness despite her claimed lack of romantic interest.

## Role in Marie's Social Circle

Boreel appears to be a regular member of the high society in Nice that Marie frequented. He attended the same social events, including:

1. The Floréal ball (January 14)
2. The Cercle Masséna (January 18)
3. The Théâtre Français (January 18)
4. Various balls and social gatherings in February

His consistent presence in these settings indicates he was part of the international aristocratic or wealthy social circle in Nice during the winter season of 1873.

## Relationship with Marie

Marie's relationship with Boreel appears complex:

1. **Initial Interest**: There are indications that Marie was initially interested in or intrigued by Boreel ("Et dire qu'il m'a tellement intéressée !" - And to think that he interested me so much!)

2. **Declining Attraction**: By mid-January, Marie's interest was waning, with specific complaints about his physical appearance and bearing

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Marie frequently uses Boreel as a point of comparison to the Duke of Hamilton, consistently finding the Duke superior

4. **Strategic Consideration**: In her February 1 entry, Marie considers practical factors in choosing between suitors, noting that if her feelings for both men were equal, she would give preference to "the richest and also to the one who will love me best"

5. **Continued Awareness**: Despite her claimed lack of interest, Marie remains acutely aware of Boreel's presence, absence, and interactions with other women at social events

## Historical Context

During the winter season in Nice in the 1870s, the city attracted wealthy and aristocratic visitors from across Europe. Young women of Marie's social class were expected to find suitable marriage partners, and social events provided opportunities for courtship under the watchful eyes of family members and chaperones.

Marie's analytical approach to her potential suitors reflects both the practical considerations of marriage in her social class and her own precocious self-awareness. Her comparison of Boreel and the Duke of Hamilton demonstrates her understanding of the "marriage market" and her own position within it.

## Identity

While Marie's diary doesn't provide extensive biographical details about Boreel, his name suggests he may have been Dutch, possibly from the prominent Boreel family of the Netherlands. The presence of international aristocracy in Nice during this period was common, with visitors from across Europe gathering in the Mediterranean resort city during the winter season.
