# Boreel

## Identity and Background

Alfred Boreel, frequently mentioned in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary, was a young man she regularly encountered during the winter social season in Nice in 1873. Based on Marie's descriptions, he appears to have been:

- A handsome young man of European aristocratic or wealthy background
- Possibly Dutch, though Marie notes confusion about his nationality
- Part of the international social scene in Nice
- Not as wealthy or high-ranking as the Duke of Hamilton, Marie's primary romantic interest

Marie initially believed him to be "Baron Finot" before learning his actual identity, causing her some disappointment as she valued titles highly.

## Physical Appearance and Characteristics

Marie provides detailed descriptions of Boreel throughout her diary:

- Described as "very beautiful" and "superb"
- Had "good gray eyes" and a "naive face that did not lack beauty"
- Marie notes his "coarse" ungloved hand, which she found appealing
- Had a mustache he would pull when displeased
- Marie criticizes his gait/walk as "ignoble" in a later marginal note
- Dressed elegantly and rode horses

## Social Activities

Boreel participated in the typical activities of wealthy visitors to Nice:

- Daily appearances on the Promenade des Anglais, often on horseback or in a carriage
- Attendance at balls and social events (appeared as a "bandit" at Carnival balls)
- Directed the cotillion at a ball at the Cercle Masséna
- Visits to Monaco, which Marie views negatively
- Participation in the carnival cavalcade

## Marie's Relationship with Boreel

Marie's feelings toward Boreel fluctuate dramatically throughout her diary:

1. **Initial Attraction**: She admits to being attracted to him and blushing when he looks at her
2. **Strategic Thinking**: She uses her apparent interest in Boreel to disguise her feelings for the Duke
3. **Disappointment**: She expresses disappointment upon learning he is not a baron
4. **Criticism**: She criticizes his behavior, particularly his visits to Monaco and alleged drinking
5. **Renewed Interest**: She admits to missing seeing him when he appears less frequently
6. **Comparison**: She constantly compares him unfavorably to the Duke of Hamilton
7. **Later Dismissal**: In marginal notes added later, she dismisses her interest in him as childish

Marie and Boreel never have a direct conversation in these diary entries. Their interaction is limited to exchanged glances, his greetings to her mother, and Marie throwing flowers to him during carnival.

## Confusion About Identity

Marie records several conflicting accounts of Boreel's background:

1. Initially believed to be "Baron Finot"
2. Identified as "M. Boreel, American"
3. Later as "M. Boreel, Dutch"
4. Finally as "M. Boreel, Prussian" (though Marie doubts this)

This confusion reflects both the international character of Nice's winter visitors and possibly Boreel's own ambiguity about his origins.

## Historical Context

The presence of young men like Boreel in Nice during the winter season was typical of the international social scene of the French Riviera in the 1870s. Wealthy families from across Europe would spend the winter months in the mild Mediterranean climate, creating a cosmopolitan social environment.

Marie's preoccupation with Boreel's title (or lack thereof) reflects the class consciousness and social hierarchies of European society in this period. Her disappointment upon learning he is not a baron reveals her social ambitions and the importance she placed on aristocratic status.

## Marie's Later Perspective

In marginal notes added to her diary in 1874, Marie is often critical of her earlier interest in Boreel:

- She calls her writings about him "detestable and stupid"
- Refers to him as "this grotesque figure" when comparing him to Hamilton
- Dismisses him as "a clumsy little joke" and "not a gentleman"
- Notes that her interest in him had already ended "since the summer" before the winter season described

These later comments suggest Marie's embarrassment about her youthful infatuation and her desire to distance herself from these feelings.

While less is known about the historical Boreel than about the Duke of Hamilton, Marie's detailed descriptions allow us to understand his role in her social world and her complex, fluctuating feelings toward him. The entry highlights how Marie's interest in Boreel reveals aspects of her character, including her class consciousness, social strategies, and tendency toward romantic idealization followed by critical reassessment. The confusion about Boreel's nationality and background also reflects the international character of Nice's winter social scene during this period.)
