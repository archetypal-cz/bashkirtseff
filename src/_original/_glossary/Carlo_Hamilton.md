### 1874
- **April 30**: Marie spots him at Place Masséna heading toward rue Masséna. "C'est Carlo, Carlo... oh Dina!" Cannot say full name "Carlo Hamilton" due to strangers present. Describes: "cette tournure d'Apollon, cette taille et cette tête petite et belle." Says he's gained weight and improved: "Il a engraissé et embelli ce cher Carlo, ce don Juan badois!" More graceful than Duke because taller and thinner. "Il rappelle son frère" but Duke still superior. Called member of "cette race hamiltonienne" - unmistakably Hamilton.
