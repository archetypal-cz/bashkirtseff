# Gioia (Amélia)

## Basic Information

Gioia (sometimes referred to as "Madame Amélia" in Marie's diary) was a beautiful woman who was the mistress of William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton. She appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as an object of both admiration and jealousy, representing Marie's complex feelings about beauty, social status, and romantic rivalry.

Marie first mentions Gioia in her diary entries from January 1873, when she observes the Duke visiting Gioia in Nice. Throughout her diary, Marie refers to Gioia using various nicknames, including "Laïs" (after a famous Greek courtesan) and "Centifolia" (a type of rose), indicating both her fascination with and objectification of this woman.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Gioia represents both an ideal of feminine beauty for Marie and a painful reminder of her unrequited love for the Duke of Hamilton. Marie's diary entries reveal her complex and contradictory feelings toward Gioia:

- **Admiration**: Marie frequently describes Gioia as "sublime," "perfect," and "beautiful like an angel," considering her the "perfection, the ideal, the divinity of woman"
- **Jealousy**: She expresses envy of Gioia's relationship with the Duke and her physical attributes
- **Identification**: Marie is flattered when others suggest she resembles Gioia, and she sometimes imitates Gioia's hairstyle
- **Obsession**: She goes out of her way to see Gioia during promenades, sometimes following her or changing routes to encounter her

Marie's encounter with Gioia's portrait at the Walery photography studio on August 26, 1873, had a particularly profound emotional impact. Her repeated viewing of Gioia's photographs and her comparison of herself to this beautiful woman demonstrates her complex emotions about beauty and romantic rivalry.

## Physical Appearance and Lifestyle

From Marie's descriptions, we learn that Gioia was:

- Tall with a "majestic" bearing and elegant manners
- Known for her beauty, though Marie notes she wore heavy makeup ("fardée comme un meunier" - "made up like a miller")
- Fashionable, with Marie describing her various outfits in detail
- Living in a luxurious villa on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice
- Wealthy enough to maintain a carriage, servants, and expensive clothing
- The mother of a son, who Marie mentions was not the Duke's child

Marie's diary provides glimpses of Gioia's lifestyle, including her home (which had a "salon gris et cerise" - gray and cherry-colored salon), her social activities, and her relationships. After the Duke of Hamilton's marriage to Lady Mary Montagu in July 1873, Gioia appears to have left Nice temporarily, with Marie noting that her house was being renovated or redecorated in late 1873, suggesting her return.

## Later Developments

Marie's diary entries from late 1873 and early 1874 suggest that Gioia's circumstances changed after the Duke's marriage. She mentions Gioia appearing in a rented landau rather than her own carriage, which Marie interprets as a sign of reduced circumstances. She also records gossip about Gioia's financial difficulties and her relationships with other men, including Count Lambertye and someone named Krassowsky.

By December 1873, Marie notes that Gioia had returned to Nice and appeared at the theater "in velvet black, old laces and diamonds." She also mentions a New Year's Eve scandal involving Gioia, Krassowsky, and another woman named Soubise at the Cercle de la Méditerranée (a social club in Nice).

## Mentions in the Diary

- **January 19, 1873**: First mention of Gioia, when Marie sees the Duke visiting her
