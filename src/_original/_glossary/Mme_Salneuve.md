## Diary References

### 1874
- **February 24**: Visited in the evening - "*Le soir Mme Salneuve*" [In the evening Mme Salneuve]

## Context

Madame Salneuve appears to have been part of the Bashkirtseff family's social circle in Nice. Her evening visit on February 24, 1874, occurred on the same day the family was arranging to purchase Villa Carlone, suggesting she may have been either a friend offering congratulations or someone with a connection to Nice society.

The brevity of Marie's mention and the formal title "Mme" indicate this was likely a social acquaintance rather than an intimate friend. Evening visits were a common social practice among the expatriate community in Nice during this period.
