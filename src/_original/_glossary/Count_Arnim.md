## Overview
Prussian count mentioned in Nice social gossip. On March 1, 1874, Marie records hearing that "the prince is a great friend of Count Arnim" - suggesting Arnim was a significant figure in diplomatic or aristocratic circles.

## Historical Context
The most prominent Count Arnim of this period was likely Harry Karl Kurt Eduard von Arnim-Suckow (1824-1881), a Prussian diplomat who served as German ambassador to France (1871-1874). His tenure was marked by conflicts with Chancellor Bismarck.

## Diplomatic Significance
If this is the diplomat Arnim, his friendship with "the prince" (likely a Russian or other European royal in Nice) would have been politically noteworthy, given the complex diplomatic relationships following the Franco-Prussian War.

## Social Standing
Count Arnim's mention in Nice society gossip indicates he was either present on the Riviera or his reputation and connections were significant enough to be discussed among the international elite.
