## Overview

Ostende (French spelling of Ostend), a fashionable Belgian seaside resort on the North Sea coast where Marie Bashkirtseff spent August 1874 with her family. The city was a major summer destination for European aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie during the 19th century.

## Marie's Stay in Ostende

Marie arrived in Ostende on August 12, 1874, after leaving Spa. She stayed with her mother, aunt, and entourage initially at various hotels before settling in an apartment at rue Longue, n° 104, which she described as a "doll's apartment" with an ocean view balcony between the Kursaal and the Casino.

## Social Life and Venues

### Key Locations
- **The Kursaal**: The main social venue where concerts were held and society gathered. Marie attended concerts here and socialized in the reading salon.
- **The Casino**: Scene of elegant balls, including the grand races ball where Marie caused a sensation with her pink outfit and remarkable shoes.
- **Cercle des Bains**: Another social venue that alternated dancing nights with the Casino.
- **The Estacade (Pier)**: Where Marie would walk and contemplate, becoming melancholy as she thought about the Duke of Hamilton.
- **The Digue (Boardwalk)**: Where society promenaded and took subscriptions for dining in the greenhouse-like structures.

## Society and Encounters

During her stay, Marie encountered various members of European aristocracy:
- Count Doenhoff (Prussian court official)
- Count Noël de Leiser (Polish nobleman naturalized English)
- Count Dounine-Barkovsky
- The young princes Kara-Georgevitch
- Various "Plobsters" (Marie's code word for attractive men)

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Ostende was known as the "Queen of Belgian Beach Resorts." The city attracted an international clientele, particularly during the summer racing season. The presence of royalty and aristocracy from across Europe made it a crucial stop on the social circuit.

The Kursaal, built in 1851-1852, was the center of cultural life, hosting concerts, balls, and other entertainments. The races were major social events that drew crowds from across Europe.

## Transportation

Ostende was well-connected by railway to Brussels and other major European cities. Marie's journey from Spa to Ostende took her through Brussels, where she stayed briefly at the Grand Hôtel Gernay.

## Marie's Impressions

Marie's feelings about Ostende were mixed. While she enjoyed the social opportunities and the attention she received (particularly at the races ball), she also experienced melancholy and continued to pine for the Duke of Hamilton. She noted the "dirty world but quantity of it" - appreciating the crowds while maintaining her aristocratic disdain.

Her most memorable moment was the sensation caused by her pink outfit with Chinese-pointed shoes at the ball on August 25, where she reported that people "almost cried out" upon seeing her feet.
