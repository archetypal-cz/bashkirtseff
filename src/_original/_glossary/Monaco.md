## Overview

The Principality of Monaco, a sovereign city-state on the French Riviera, was undergoing a dramatic transformation during Marie Bashkirtseff's time. From near-bankruptcy in the 1850s, Monaco had become one of Europe's most glamorous destinations by the 1870s, thanks to the establishment of the Monte Carlo Casino. Marie frequently refers to both "Monaco" and "Monte Carlo" in her diary, often using the terms interchangeably.
