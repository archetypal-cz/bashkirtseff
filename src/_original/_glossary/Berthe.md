**Research Status**: Basic
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-30
**Diary Coverage**: Up to 1874-01-01

## Overview

Berthe appears in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a potential romantic rival, particularly in connection with the Duke of Hamilton. She is mentioned during the crucial period of summer and fall 1873 when Marie is obsessed with Hamilton.

## Key Appearances

### September 1, 1873
Marie's mother mentions: "Et comment Berthe a dit que Hamilton l'épousera absolument" (And how Berthe said that Hamilton will absolutely marry her). This claim devastates Marie and intensifies her jealousy and anxiety about Hamilton's romantic interests.

### The Boyd Connection
There are references to "Boyd et Berthe" suggesting Berthe may be connected to the Boyd family, possibly as Berthe Boyd. The Boyd family appears to be part of the English or Scottish expatriate community in Nice.

## Role in Marie's Emotional Life

Berthe represents:
- **A Romantic Threat**: Someone who claims Hamilton will marry her
- **Social Competition**: Part of the same social circles competing for eligible men
- **Source of Anxiety**: Her claims about Hamilton cause Marie significant distress

## Social Context

In the 1870s Nice winter season, young women of marriageable age from wealthy families competed for the attention of eligible bachelors. The Duke of Hamilton, as one of the wealthiest and most titled young men, was the ultimate prize. Berthe's confident claims about marrying him would have been seen as either:
- Based on real encouragement from Hamilton
- Bold social maneuvering
- Wishful thinking

## Relationship to Other Figures

- **Duke of Hamilton**: Object of her matrimonial ambitions
- **Boyd Family**: Possibly related or connected
- **Marie Bashkirtseff**: Rival for Hamilton's affections

## Historical Note

The competition between young women for eligible men in 19th century high society was intense and often cruel. Public claims about engagements or promises of marriage were serious matters that could damage reputations if proven false.

## Questions for Further Research

- Is Berthe's last name Boyd?
- Did she have any real connection to Hamilton?
- What happened to her after Hamilton's engagement to Lady Mary Montagu?
- Was she part of the British or French expatriate community?
