# French Theater in Nice

## Basic Information

The French Theater in Nice (Théâtre Français de Nice) was an important cultural venue in Nice during the 1870s. It hosted French-language theatrical productions, including both classical plays and contemporary comedies. The theater served as a social gathering place for the local elite and foreign visitors, particularly the Russian expatriate community that had established itself in Nice.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Marie Bashkirtseff attended the opening night of the 1873-1874 season at the French Theater on September 13, 1873. Her detailed description of this event provides valuable insights into both the theatrical culture of Nice and the social dynamics of the Russian community there.

For Marie, the theater represented an important social venue where she could display her fashion sense, observe others, and participate in the cultural life of Nice. Her diary entry about the theater visit reveals her concern with proper appearance (changing from her preferred gray dress to a white one at her mother's insistence) and her strong sense of social propriety (being scandalized by the presence of her father's mistress, Anna, in a nearby box).

The theater also served as a place of cultural education for Marie, as evidenced by her detailed summary of the play "Le changement de mains" about Empress Elisabeth of Russia, showing her interest in Russian history and theatrical narratives.

## Historical Context

In the 1870s, Nice had become a popular winter resort for wealthy Europeans, particularly Russians. The city had been part of the Kingdom of Sardinia until 1860, when it was annexed to France. This relatively recent change in national identity meant that Nice in the 1870s was a cosmopolitan city with Italian, French, and international influences.

The French Theater was part of Nice's cultural infrastructure that catered to this international elite. Theatrical performances were a central part of social life for the upper classes in the 19th century, providing entertainment, cultural enrichment, and opportunities for social display and interaction.

The 1873-1874 theater season opened with two productions: "Le changement de mains" (The Change of Hands), a historical drama set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of Empress Elisabeth, and "Les jocrisses de l'amour" (The Fools of Love), a comedy that Marie found too risqué and left after the second act.

## Social Significance

The theater served multiple social functions beyond entertainment:

1. **Social Display**: The theater was a place to see and be seen, with attention paid to dress, appearance, and social connections.

2. **Class Boundaries**: The box system at the theater physically manifested social hierarchies, with better boxes indicating higher status.

3. **Moral Boundaries**: Marie's reaction to the "crude" comedy and her decision to leave shows how the theater could also be a site for negotiating moral propriety.

4. **Community Formation**: For the Russian expatriate community in Nice, the theater provided a gathering place and cultural connection.
