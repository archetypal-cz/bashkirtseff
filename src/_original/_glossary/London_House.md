# London House

London House was a popular upscale confectionery and café in Nice frequently mentioned in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary. It served as both a refreshment spot and a social hub for the aristocracy and wealthy visitors to the French Riviera in the 1870s.

## Description

Based on Marie's diary entries, London House appears to have been an elegant establishment with multiple rooms or sections. It featured a counter staffed by women who, according to Marie, understood English conversations. The café was spacious enough to accommodate multiple small tables and served as a meeting place where patrons might encounter acquaintances.

## Location

While the exact address is not specified in Marie's diary, London House was located in central Nice, apparently near the Promenade des Anglais. Marie mentions walking from the promenade to London House on multiple occasions, suggesting it was conveniently situated for the city's fashionable visitors.

## Menu and Offerings

London House offered an extensive menu of refreshments and delicacies, including:

- Hot chocolate (Marie's frequent order)
- Ice cream ("des glaces magnifiques")
- Pastries and cakes
- Fruits (oranges, grapes, strawberries, peaches)
- Smoked salmon
- Foie gras
- Sandwiches
- Preserved meats ("cochon de lait en conserve")
- Champagne

Marie describes one particularly eclectic meal at London House: "trois petites tables rondes de différentes hauteurs réunies, sur lesquelles on voit à la fois servis du chocolat, du saumon fumé, des glaces, des gâteaux, des sandwichs, des fraises, du foie gras et du raisin, sans couverts" (three small round tables of different heights joined together, on which were served all at once chocolate, smoked salmon, ice cream, cakes, sandwiches, strawberries, foie gras and grapes, without cutlery).

## Social Significance

London House played an important role in Marie's social life in Nice. It was a place where she would:

1. **Socialize with friends**: Marie frequently visited with "Bête" (Miss Howard), her father, or other companions.

2. **Observe society**: The café provided opportunities to see and be seen by Nice's high society.

3. **Engage in conversation**: Many of Marie's significant conversations about the Duke of Hamilton and other matters took place at London House.

4. **Find comfort**: Marie notes, "Toutes les fois que je suis au London House je suis gaie" (Every time I am at London House I am cheerful).

5. **Establish routine**: Marie mentions being "si habituée à aller avant dîner au London House" (so accustomed to going to London House before dinner).

## Historical Context

Establishments like London House catered to the international aristocracy and wealthy tourists who flocked to Nice during the winter season. The name "London House" itself reflects the strong British presence in Nice during this period. The French Riviera had become a fashionable winter resort for the British aristocracy since the late 18th century, and by the 1870s, Nice had a substantial English-speaking community.

Such cafés and confectioneries served as important social spaces where the elite could display their wealth and status while enjoying luxuries imported from across Europe. The presence of English-speaking staff and English food items (like smoked salmon) indicates how these establishments catered specifically to the international clientele of Nice.
