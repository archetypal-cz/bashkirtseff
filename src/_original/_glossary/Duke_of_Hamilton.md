# Duke of Hamilton

## Basic Information

William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, the 12th Duke of Hamilton (1845–1895), was a Scottish nobleman and a significant figure in British aristocratic circles during the late 19th century. He held multiple titles including Duke of Hamilton and Duke of Brandon, and was the Premier Peer of Scotland.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

The Duke of Hamilton features prominently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as the object of her intense infatuation during 1873. Despite having no actual relationship with him, Marie developed a deep romantic fixation on the Duke after seeing him in Nice. Her diary entries from August 1873 reveal her excitement at potentially seeing him in Paris and her conflicted feelings about her attraction to him.

On August 19, 1873, Marie engages in introspection about whether she truly loves the Duke or if it's merely her imagination. Her emotional reactions to not seeing him during her Paris visit, and her dramatic statement that she would "go to China just to see him pass by," reveal the depth of her infatuation.

Marie's obsession with the Duke represents her romantic idealism and her aspirations to move in the highest circles of European aristocracy. Her fixation on him also reveals her emotional intensity and tendency toward melodramatic imagination.

The entries from late August and early September 1873 show how Marie's infatuation with the Duke became a topic of family discussion and teasing after her return to Nice. Her mother appears skeptical of the match, suggesting the Duke's income is much lower than Marie believes, while others like Princess Galitzine encourage Marie's fantasies by calling her "duchesse" (duchess). Marie expresses frustration that her private feelings have become public knowledge, writing "I am vexed, I did not want Hamilton to become public. For, what humiliation if nothing succeeds!"

## Physical Appearance and Character

From Marie's diary entries, we learn that she is attracted to the Duke's physical appearance, describing him as tall, large/stout, and red-haired or ruddy-complexioned. She repeatedly mentions her preference for "les grands, gros, blonds" (tall, stout, blond men) when discussing potential husbands with her family.

Marie's family and acquaintances describe the Duke as eccentric or original. Walitsky tells anecdotes about the Duke bringing a pig to a promenade when dogs were forbidden, and serving soup in chamber pots at a breakfast he hosted. While these stories may be exaggerated or fabricated to tease Marie, they suggest the Duke had a reputation for unconventional behavior.

## Financial Status

Marie's diary reveals conflicting information about the Duke's wealth. Her family discusses his income, with estimates ranging from 3,000 to 90,000 pounds sterling annually. Marie's aunt mentions that "he has become poor" and now has only 20,000 pounds instead of 90,000. Marie insists this is still substantial (equivalent to 500,000 francs), though her mother tries to diminish this amount in their conversations.

Marie frankly admits she would not marry the Duke if he were poor, writing: "Alas no! I will not marry him if he is poor, but I will always love him. I cannot marry a poor man, it is against my nature, it would be the misfortune of both."

## Historical Context

In 1873, the Duke of Hamilton was 28 years old and would marry Lady Mary Montagu later that same year (on July 10, 1873). He was known for his aristocratic lifestyle and passion for horse racing, though his financial difficulties were significant despite inheriting vast estates.

His horse Cortolvin had won the Grand National Steeplechase in 1867, but by 1873, his racing fortunes had apparently declined. Marie mentions in her diary that he is "reduced to a single horse instead of five" and "for three years he has fallen in the races, arriving only third."

The Duke had significant family connections to European royalty. His mother, Princess Marie Amelie of Baden, was the sister of the Grand Duke of Baden, who was married to the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm I of Prussia. This made the Duke of Hamilton a nephew by marriage to the Prussian royal family.

Marie mentions receiving "The Derby" newspaper and being pleased to see the Duke's name mentioned frequently in it, indicating his continued involvement in horse racing circles.

## Later Life

The Duke's marriage to Lady Mary Montagu produced one daughter, Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. His later years were marked by declining health and financial difficulties. He died in 1895 at the age of 50, with his titles passing to his cousin Alfred Douglas Douglas-Hamilton.
