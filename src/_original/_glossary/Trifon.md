## Diary References

### 1874
- **April 29**: Suspected in theft of 1,200 roubles from papa's cassette. Marie notes "le père nous servit quarante ans et lui-même Trifon est ★en calèche depuis qu'il sait marcher" (his father served us forty years and Trifon himself has been ★in carriage since he could walk). Family won't call police: "si même c'est ce pauvre garçon qui a volé (quel mot terrible !) on lui pardonnera." Trifon himself "très excité" about accusation.

## Context
- Multi-generational service (father 40 years)
- "En calèche" unclear - possibly coachman
- Star indicates textual uncertainty
- Family loyalty vs. theft suspicion
- Class paternalism - won't prosecute
- Shows servant-master relationships

## Research Notes
