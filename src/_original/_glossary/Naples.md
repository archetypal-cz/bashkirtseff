## Diary References

### 1874
- **March 11**: After Lewin ball invitation rejection, Marie and mother discuss: "Nous avons parlé de vendre 55 et nous en aller à Naples, car à Nice il n'y a plus de salut pour nous!" (We talked about selling 55 and going to Naples, for in Nice there is no salvation for us!)

## Context
- Naples = major cultural center in southern Italy
- Popular winter resort for European aristocracy
- Alternative to Nice for social outcasts
- The dramatic "no salvation" shows depth of social crisis
- Selling Villa Carlone (55) would be major step

## Research Notes
- Naples under Kingdom of Italy since 1861
