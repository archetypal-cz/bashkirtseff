# Miloradovitch

Gritsia Miloradovitch was a young Russian nobleman who appears frequently in Marie Bashkirtseff's diary as a potential suitor strongly favored by her mother. 

## Background

Miloradovitch came from a wealthy Russian family, with Marie mentioning he had an annual income of 75,000 rubles, which she considered insufficient despite her mother's insistence that it was "énorme" (enormous). He was described as young, handsome, and importantly "seul" (alone) - without siblings, which Marie noted was "un grand bonheur" (a great happiness) in terms of inheritance.

## Relationship with Marie

Marie knew Miloradovitch from childhood in Russia. She mentions that when she left Russia at age eleven, "ce Miloradovitch m'a fait la cour, mais nous étions enfants" (this Miloradovitch courted me, but we were children). Her mother and aunt cherished the romantic notion of a childhood love blossoming into marriage, with Marie noting they spoke of it as "si poétique, depuis l'enfance, un amour éternel" (so poetic, since childhood, an eternal love).

## Marie's Attitude

Marie consistently rejected the idea of marrying Miloradovitch, despite her mother's persistent efforts to arrange a match. She described him dismissively as "un enfant gâté" (a spoiled child) and "un petit rien-du-tout" (a little nothing-at-all). Her objection stemmed partly from his lack of experience - she noted he "n'a pas fait de bêtises" (hasn't made mistakes/had experiences), which she considered a negative trait in a potential husband.

When comparing him to the Duke of Hamilton, Marie wrote: "Miloradovitch est riche, jeune, noble et seul, mais je ne l'aime pas. Hamilton a tout." (Miloradovitch is rich, young, noble and alone, but I don't love him. Hamilton has everything.)

## Mother's Matchmaking

Marie's mother was determined to arrange a marriage between Marie and Miloradovitch. In her diary, Marie notes that her mother wanted her to travel to Vienna partly because "à Vienne sont Mme Miloradovitch et son fils" (in Vienna are Madame Miloradovitch and her son). Her mother hoped to arrange "une espèce d'entrevue comme le duc d'Edimbourg et la duchesse Marie; par hasard nous voir à Vienne" (a kind of meeting like the Duke of Edinburgh and Duchess Marie; by chance to see each other in Vienna).

Marie frequently complained about her mother's persistence on this matter, writing "Maman ne pense qu'à Miloradovitch" (Mama thinks only of Miloradovitch) and "C'est le rêve le plus cher de maman que j'épouse Miloradovitch, elle ne pense qu'à cela" (It is mama's dearest dream that I marry Miloradovitch, she thinks only of that).

## Historical Context

The Miloradovitch family was a prominent noble family in the Russian Empire. While we don't have specific biographical details about Gritsia Miloradovitch from external sources, the family name was well-known. The most famous bearer of the name was Count Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich (1771-1825), a Russian general who fought in the Napoleonic Wars and was killed during the Decembrist uprising.

Marie's rejection of Miloradovitch in favor of her infatuation with the Duke of Hamilton reflects the social aspirations of the Russian nobility in the late 19th century, many of whom looked to Western European aristocracy as socially superior.
