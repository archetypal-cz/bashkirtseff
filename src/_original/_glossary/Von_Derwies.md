## Diary References

### 1874
- **February 25**: Host concerts that Marie is eager to attend
- **March 2**: At their Valrose concert, sit in shell-shaped box like princes. Marie reflects that 20 years ago, M. von Derwies was "un pauvre commis" (poor clerk) and his wife had two percale dresses, wearing one while washing the other, going to market with basket under arm, without hat. Marie finds their rise "surprenant et ébouriffant" (surprising and mind-boggling).

## Context
- Nouveau riche family who built Valrose
- Host charity concerts in their concert hall
- Represent social mobility through wealth
- Their vulgar display of wealth offends Marie's aristocratic sensibilities
- Shell-shaped box shows theatrical ostentation
- Story of their poverty emphasizes rapid social rise

## Property
- **Valrose**: Immense villa with false ruins, cascades, grottos, statues, fountains
- Architecture described as "atroce" (atrocious) - "obélisque" of bad taste
- New concert hall in white stucco and light blue velvet
- Stone-covered courtyard over terraces

## Research Notes
- Likely Pavel von Derwies (1826-1881), Russian railway magnate
- Built fortune from railway concessions in Russia
- Valrose still exists as University of Nice campus
