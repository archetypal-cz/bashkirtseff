A theatrical farce performed at the French Theater in Nice on May 2, 1873, during Fontaine's benefit performance. Marie describes it as "une farce comme je n'en ai jamais vu" (a farce like I've never seen), suggesting it was particularly silly or outrageous.

"Cadet Roussel" was based on a popular French folk song character from the late 18th century, originally mocking a real person named Guillaume Joseph Roussel. The character became a stock figure in French popular culture, often portrayed as a bumbling, ridiculous figure.
