# Paul

## Basic Information

Paul was a male family member of Marie Bashkirtseff, likely a cousin or brother, who lived with the family in Nice during 1873. He appears to have been close in age to Marie and participated in family activities and outings.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Paul served multiple roles in Marie's daily life:
- **Shopping Companion**: Accompanied Marie on shopping expeditions, including purchasing gifts for feast days
- **Riding Companion**: Went to Monaco to practice pigeon shooting
- **Family Mediator**: Sometimes took Marie's side in family disputes
- **Social Participant**: Attended dinners and social events with the family

His presence provided Marie with a peer companion, though she sometimes criticized his behavior (as when he told "purs mensonges" about her riding abilities).

## Historical Context

In aristocratic Russian families, it was common for extended family members to live together or spend long periods visiting. Young male relatives often served as appropriate escorts for unmarried female family members, providing a respectable alternative to going out only with female chaperones.
