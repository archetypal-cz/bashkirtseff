# Walitsky (Walitzky)

## Basic Information

Walitsky was a family friend or associate of the Bashkirtseffs in Nice during 1873. He appears to have had some social connections with the Duke of Hamilton and served as an intermediary figure between Marie's family and wider Nice society. His name is sometimes spelled "Walitzky" in the diary.

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Life

Walitsky played several important roles:
- **Hamilton Connection**: Promised to bring the Duke of Hamilton to visit ("cet hiver j'amènerai Hamilton")
- **Source of Information**: Shared stories and made jokes about Hamilton
- **Family Friend**: Participated in family activities and discussions
- **Authority Figure**: Involved in disciplining the servant Palajka

His promise to bring Hamilton to visit had a dramatic effect on Marie's mood, transforming her from tears to joy in an instant.

## Historical Context

In 19th-century expatriate society, well-connected individuals who could facilitate introductions were highly valued. Walitsky appears to have moved in the same social circles as Hamilton and could therefore serve as a potential bridge between Marie's family and the Duke.
