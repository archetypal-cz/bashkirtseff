## Identity
Monaco pigeon shoot participant whom Marie considers "le bon Merck" (good Merck).

## Diary References

### 1874
- **January 14**: Marie describes him as having "l'air le plus comme il faut" (looking the most proper) among all the "canaille" (rabble), except for his teeth. This prompts Marie's thought about examining everyone's teeth like they do with horses.

## Notes
- Marie's comment about examining teeth suggests dental issues were common
- Despite this flaw, she considers him more respectable than most of the shooting crowd
