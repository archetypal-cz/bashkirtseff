## Diary References

### 1874
- **January 14**: At the Monaco pigeon shoot, Marie describes her as "ce gros cocher" (that fat coachman) who came to "grimace and cry in her ugly French." She repeatedly exclaimed "Pauvre pigeon, pauvre pigeon!" (Poor pigeon, poor pigeon!) about the birds being shot.

## Marie's Commentary
- Marie calls her performance of sensitivity "sensibilités insensibles" (insensitive sensitivities)
- Questions why she attends if the pigeons' suffering upsets her so much
- "Quelle horreur!" Marie mocks her false sentiment
- Example of hypocritical behavior that revolted Marie

## Notes
- Poor French suggests recent arrival or limited education
- Marie's "gros cocher" insult implies masculine/coarse appearance
- Represents type of society person Marie found insufferable
