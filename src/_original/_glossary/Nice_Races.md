### 1874
- **January 15**: Marie attends but feels "la plus malheureuse" (most miserable). She describes the races as where "society and toilettes were extraordinarily brilliant." High society attendees included princesses, duchesses, and viscountesses. Marie's family remains isolated while others socialize freely.

## Social Function
- Primary venue for society to see and be seen
- Display of fashion and wealth ("belles toilettes")
- Networking and matchmaking opportunities
- "On se rencontre, on se connaît" (one meets, one knows each other)
- Strict social hierarchies visible in interactions

## Historical Context

- Combined British sporting traditions with French elegance

## Marie's Experience
