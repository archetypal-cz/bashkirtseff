# Document Humain

## Overview

"Document Humain" (Human Document) is a literary concept that became particularly significant in late 19th century French literature, especially in naturalist and realist movements. The term refers to authentic, unfiltered human experiences and emotions documented in a way that reveals psychological and social truths.

## Literary Context

The concept of "document humain" was popularized by the Goncourt brothers (Edmond and Jules) and later championed by Émile Zola as part of the naturalist literary movement. It represented a shift away from romanticism toward a more scientific, observational approach to human behavior and society.

Writers who embraced this concept sought to:
1. Record human experiences with clinical precision
2. Document the psychological, physiological, and social aspects of human behavior
3. Present unvarnished truths about human nature and society
4. Use personal observations and experiences as source material for literature

## Significance in Marie Bashkirtseff's Diary

Marie Bashkirtseff's diary itself is considered a prime example of a "document humain." Her unflinching self-analysis, detailed observations of her emotions, and candid documentation of her thoughts exemplify the concept.

When Marie uses the hashtag #Document_Humain in her diary, she is typically marking passages that:
1. Reveal particularly raw or authentic emotions
2. Document her unfiltered psychological states
3. Record socially significant or revealing moments
4. Capture experiences that might serve as material for understanding human nature

For example, in her January 12, 1873 entry, she uses this tag when describing her fortune-telling ritual and her fantasies about becoming the Duchess of Hamilton. This represents a candid documentation of her romantic aspirations and psychological state.

Similarly, in her January 13 entry, she uses the tag when describing her dream about seeking an introduction to the Duke of Hamilton, again documenting her authentic desires and social ambitions.

In her January 19 entry, the tag appears when she describes her physical reactions to seeing the Duke (foot-tapping, blushing) and her governess's reprimand, capturing a moment of genuine emotional vulnerability.

## Historical Significance

Marie's use of this concept connects her diary to the broader literary movements of her time. Though she began her diary before the term was widely popularized, her approach aligns perfectly with the naturalist emphasis on psychological truth and social observation.

The fact that Marie was aware of and using this concept suggests her literary sophistication and her connection to contemporary intellectual currents, despite her young age when beginning the diary.

Her diary would later be celebrated precisely for its quality as a "document humain," offering insights into the psychology of a young woman coming of age in late 19th century European high society.

## Connection to Marie's Artistic Development

As Marie later developed her artistic ambitions, this concept would have resonated with her approach to painting as well. The naturalist emphasis on observing and documenting reality without idealization parallels many of the developments in late 19th century painting, particularly in the realist and naturalist movements.

Marie's diary, with its emphasis on psychological truth and detailed observation, foreshadows her later artistic sensibilities and her desire to capture authentic human experiences in her art.
