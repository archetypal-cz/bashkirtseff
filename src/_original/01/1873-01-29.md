[//]: # ( 2025-03-23T00:28:47 RED: This brief entry provides a glimpse into Marie's daily life and accomplishments. Her horseback riding shows her privileged lifestyle, while her music practice and English lessons demonstrate her dedication to her education[^01.56.1]. The enthusiastic description of her ride ("splendide") and the energetic "galopé pendant des heures" reveal her passionate nature, even when describing activities unrelated to the Duke. This entry serves as a reminder that despite her romantic obsession, she maintained an active life of her own. )

[^01.56.1]: Marie's English lessons with Mlle Collignon had begun on January 12, 1872, as noted in a previous entry. This consistent study would later enable her to write parts of her diary in English.
