[//]: # ( 2025-03-23T00:27:10 RED: This entry provides insight into Nice's social scene and Marie's changing attitudes. The Cercle Masséna was a prestigious social club[^01.20.1], and the mention of her mother dancing suggests the family's full integration into society life. The theatrical performance of "Les martyrs de l'inquisition" indicates the kind of dramatic entertainment popular at the time. Marie's reaction to Boreel - "presque rien... Etrange!" - shows her growing emotional sophistication and self-awareness, as she analyzes her own changing feelings. The ellipsis and exclamation create a contemplative yet surprised tone. )

[^01.20.1]: The Cercle Masséna was named after André Masséna, one of Napoleon's marshals who was born in Nice. It was an important social institution where the local aristocracy and wealthy visitors gathered for balls, concerts, and other cultural events.
