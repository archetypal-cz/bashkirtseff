[//]: # ( 2025-03-23T00:29:40 RED: This short entry captures Marie's mounting excitement about the upcoming races, where she hopes to see the Duke. Her exclamation "Quelle joie!" and the reference to answered prayers show how she frames even brief glimpses of him as divine gifts. The contrast between his closed carriage ("voiture fermée") and her terrace position creates a metaphorical image of their social distance. Her satisfaction with simply seeing him, even though he doesn't notice her, shows both the intensity and the one-sided nature of her feelings. )

[^01.72.1]: The races were major social events in Nice's winter season, providing opportunities for the local society to gather and display their status. For Marie, they represented a chance to see the Duke in a public setting where her presence would be socially acceptable.
