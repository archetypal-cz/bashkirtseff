# Coslate
### Coslate means collaborative translate - humans and AIs together.

This project is a template for a translation - both long and short, weak and strong.

## AI Installation and Customization
When a user clones this template repository and opens it with an AI agent (currently VSCode with Cline and Claude Sonnet 3.5 or 3.7), the AI should guide the user through the following installation and customization process:

1. **Initial Project Understanding**:
   - Ask the user about the source material to be translated (type, length, language, complexity).
   - Inquire about the target language and audience.
   - Understand the user's translation goals and any specific requirements.

2. **Project Configuration**:
   - Determine the paragraph ID format for the project (e.g., 01.01 for first document, first paragraph).
   - Establish file naming conventions for the translation workflow (*.done.md, *.proof.md, *.red.md).
   - Decide on the final output format(s) needed (HTML, EPUB, PDF, etc.).

3. **Style Definition**:
   - Work with the user to define the translation style and approach.
   - Update `./prompts/Style.md` with detailed guidelines about:
     - How closely to follow the original text's style
     - Handling of cultural references
     - Treatment of idioms and metaphors
     - Voice and tone preferences
     - Any specific terminology requirements

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update the README.md with a comprehensive project description.
   - Modify these .clinerules to reflect the specific translation project.
   - Create or update necessary documentation in the ./docs folder.

5. **Technical Setup**:
   - Configure VSCode tasks for compilation and preview.
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds if needed.
   - Install and configure any necessary Python packages via Poetry.

6. **AI Role Definition**:
   - Define the specific AI roles needed for this translation project.
   - Create appropriate prompts in the ./prompts folder for each role.

The AI should document all decisions and configurations made during this process, ensuring the project is fully set up and ready for translation work to begin.

## Developing Coslate
We have ./memlog, where we save in datetime stamped files overall information about what work was successfully done (finished, tested, documentation updated is the definition of done for the template part of the project).

Plans on what should be done go into ./memlog/*-plan.md files and we keep it precise and current by marking sections as completed and cleaning up things once some larger unit of work is done. 

We have a main ./Plan.md, which we maintain at the end of every successful session to link sub-plan.md files in ./memlog and mark what has been done. 

Our aim is to have the user clone this template repo and collaborate with an AI agent to create a customized translation environment. The AI should help the user determine what the resulting product should be and what the presentation should look like, by suggesting prompt improvements. Whatever the final product should be (markdown files merged into one and turned into HTML probably), the AI should suggest updating or creating mechanisms for automatic compilation and publication with VSCode tasks, GitHub Actions and possibly other pipelines.

But before we get there, we need to set up the template itself, since this project here - starting with these .clinerules, README.md that will hold the gist of it, ./docs/ folder, where we will store reference literature, translation memory and other useful things for both the template development and the translation itself.

Part of this template project should be ./prompts, because the AI agents working on this projects will need to be able to take on several separate roles - exquisite literary translator, who is able to take the spirit of the original and infuse the translation with its own version of the spirit, empathetic and attentive redactor, who sees where the tired eye left too forced a translation and where things could be improved, godlike proofreader who knows all the grammar (helps to have all the rules for your language in ./docs/grammar)... 

And we should also make is self-contained as much as possible, so we'll have some Python 3.12 managed via Poetry with packages installed into the project folder, all in ./scripts and possibly ./bin for other tools.

We should have VSCode tasks, that will run scripts to compile whatever is in ./src (suggestion is to have 10_Chapter_001_Home.md, 20_Chapter_002_Journey.md etc.) into a single file in ./pub, then maybe convert it to HTML using some ./templates, have a way to save it as EPUB.

Don't hesitate to list files in folders and search for strings, the filenames should be explanatory, and include anything that looks like it could be pertinent.

When translating, we see to filenames (*.done.md is already finished, *.proof.md is in need of proofreading, *.red.md would be for redaction) where to start.

# .MD File Format
In the beginning, there is only the original, lets say just 01.md, 02.md and 03.md. 

We take 01.md, read all the context we could use from ./docs etc. And we start working paragraph by paragraph, section by section - first we put the original part as a comment, insert a line after with another comment, marking the id of the paragraph - depends on project and should be decided by the user during the install process with AI in the beginning. In our case, it's 01.01 - first document, first paragraph.
Then come other optional comments - for more complex paragraphs, we might need a longer deliberation of what options the translation has, and then deciding according to the ./prompts/Style.md - all in the comments under paragraph id.
And then comes the polished translation, with footnotes where we include something, which might not be obvious to the reader. 
And after that, we have another paragraph in original, so anytime we stop, we can see which is the last paragraph to have a translation, and the resulting artifacts can be compiled anytime and both the translated part and the unfinished part will be readable.
 
Media files go in ./src/media
