# Diagnostics Report — 2026-02-10

## Project Health: EXCELLENT

### Source Preparation
- **RSR (Research)**: 99.9% complete — 4 entries remaining (037, 060, 063, 067)
- **LAN (Linguistic Annotation)**: 99.9% complete — 5 entries remaining
- **Carnet 083 fix**: 73 entries had completed LAN work but flags were stuck at `false` — all fixed
- **101 of 107 carnets** fully ready for translation (6 have 1-2 entries pending)

### Glossary Health
- **3,193 entries** across 41 categories
- **0 broken links** (all referenced entries exist)
- **102 orphaned entries** (exist but never referenced — review needed)
- **795 stub entries** (under 200 bytes) — enrichment in progress

### DOCX Fidelity
- **99% overall match rate** across 16 tomes
- **1,647 paragraphs** flagged as "not found" (mostly trivial: date headers, short dialogue)
- **~50-100 significant mismatches** needing manual review
- See `PARAGRAPHS_TO_CHECK.md` for specific paragraph IDs

### Formatting
- **2,573 italic/bold corrections** already applied from DOCX
- **50+ files** with orphaned asterisk markers (need manual check)
- **10 files** with nested bold/italic issues

### Translation Readiness
- Translation has NOT yet begun (111 Czech scaffold files exist, no content)
- Once 4 RSR + 5 LAN entries complete: **100% ready**

## Action Items
1. Complete RSR on 4 entries (agent working on this)
2. Complete LAN on 5 entries (agent working on this)
3. Review orphaned asterisks against raw page scans
4. Review ~100 DOCX mismatches
5. Investigate 328 Kernberger-only dates
